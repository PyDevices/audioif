# AGENTS.md — audioif

CircuitPython's audio system (`audiocore`, `synthio`, `audiomixer`, effects,
`audiomp3`), ported to MicroPython as `USER_C_MODULES` usermods. Import
names match CircuitPython exactly (`import audiocore`, `import synthio`, …)
for source compatibility; only this repo's own name differs.

## Layout

- Root: `micropython.mk` (unix/windows, Make-based ports), `micropython.cmake`
  (esp32/rp2, CMake-based ports) — build glue for `USER_C_MODULES` discovery
- `src/` — one directory per module (`audiocore/`, `synthio/`, `audiomixer/`,
  `audiospeed/`, `audiofreeverb/`, `audiofilters/`, `audiodelays/`,
  `audiomp3/`, `audiodynamics/`, `audioroute/`, `audiomath/`, `audioecho/`),
  plus `src/cp_compat/`
  (CircuitPython-only core primitives ported as standalone compat shims, each
  individually verified against mainline MicroPython before use — not assumed
  missing) and `src/shared/` (runtime-neutral DSP the MicroPython usermod and
  the CPython extension both compile)
- `src/cpython/` — the whole CPython target: `_audioif.c`, the extension built
  in place, and the twelve modules that wrap it (`audiocore.py`, `synthio.py`,
  …). They install as top-level modules, so it is `import audiocore` no matter
  which of the three runtimes is underneath. Nothing puts this directory on
  `sys.path`: audioif is a dependency, imported from wherever it is installed.
- `lib/` — the pure-Python tier: `lib/audiorender/` (whole-composition
  offline rendering — numpy, desktop-only, never frozen), which ships inside
  the `pydevices-audioif` wheel. The instrument and effect libraries that
  used to sit beside it — `audioinstruments` (53 `synthio` instruments) and
  `audioeffects` (46 effect classes, racks included) — live in
  [audiocomponents](https://github.com/PyDevices/audiocomponents) now, as
  their own distributions depending on `pydevices-audioif`; nothing in this
  repository builds, tests, publishes or freezes them.
- `apply_cp_patches.sh` + `src/circuitpython_spike/` — add `audiodynamics`,
  `audioroute`, `audiomath` and `audioecho` to a CircuitPython tree. None of
  the four is a CircuitPython port: the first two come from micropython-vst3's
  `vstaudio` engine and the last two are audioif's own, so CircuitPython gains
  them here rather than the other way round.
- `docs/porting-plan.md` — the full phased porting history, architecture,
  and target layout
- `docs/upstream-diff.md` — every deliberate deviation from upstream
  CircuitPython, with rationale (verbatim-kept quirks vs. genuine port bugs
  found and fixed)
- `tests/parity/` — oracle-diff scripts, run unchanged against both this
  port and `bin/circuitpython`
- `tests/vendor/` — vendored third-party test fixtures (e.g. `synthtools`)

## Sibling dependencies (cloned, not vendored)

- `ulab` (numpy-alike) — pinned to the exact revision CircuitPython itself
  vendors
- `cmods/mp3` (upstream `adafruit/Adafruit_MP3`, the Helix MP3 decoder core
  `audiomp3` wraps) — RPSL 1.0/RCSL 1.0 licensed, *not* MIT; carried
  unmodified per upstream's own terms, same as CircuitPython itself. Kept
  as a separate sibling clone rather than folded into this (MIT) repo's own
  tree.

Both are expected as siblings in the parent workspace (`cmods/` in
`pydevices`), same pattern as `pygraphics`/`displayif`.

## Testing

- Oracle diffing is the core discipline: every parity script under
  `tests/parity/` runs unchanged against this port and `bin/circuitpython`,
  rendering PCM and diffing byte-for-byte (or documenting the exact,
  bounded exception in `docs/upstream-diff.md`).
- One tier has a different oracle, because CircuitPython is not where it
  came from. It is the micropython-vst3 sibling checkout, and the gate never
  touches it:
  `.venv/bin/python tests/parity/verify_dsp.py --micropython ../cmods/bin/micropython \
  --circuitpython ../cmods/bin/circuitpython \
  --oracle ../cmods/micropython/ports/unix/build-vstaudio-oracle/micropython`
  holds `audiodynamics` and `audioroute` to `vstaudio_dsp.c` compiled
  unmodified by `MP_UNIX=../cmods/micropython/ports/unix
  ULAB_DIR=../cmods/ulab tests/parity/build_vstaudio_oracle.sh`. One hash
  covers every interpreter here: the arithmetic is all in `src/shared/`, so
  two interpreters disagreeing would itself be the finding. `audiomath`
  rides along in the same file with no oracle at all — captured from the
  port, it pins cross-interpreter agreement rather than fidelity to
  something older.
- The instruments parity gate — `run_instruments_parity.py`, its two probes,
  `instrument_sequences.py` and the `instruments_*.json` digests — lives in
  [audiocomponents](https://github.com/PyDevices/audiocomponents) now, under
  its `tests/parity/`, beside the packages it renders. Its `REBUILT` rule (a
  name there records a sound changed **on purpose**, and adding one is
  Brad's call, never an agent's) is documented in that repository's
  AGENTS.md. It is not run from here.
- That oracle is `vstaudio_dsp.c`, which micropython-vst3 no longer carries
  — it imports audioif now. It is read out of that checkout's git history,
  so it stays fixed no matter what the checkout does next. What covers the
  cutover itself is `python3 tests/parity/capture_render_reference.py
  --verify`: it renders the plug-in's six soundtrack pieces and compares
  them with what they sounded like beforehand. The interpreter it renders
  with needs `audioinstruments` and `audioeffects` installed from
  audiocomponents (or `--components-lib <checkout>/lib`); they are no
  longer in this tree. Slow (~15 min) and not part of the default gate, but
  **re-capture it after any DSP change here** or it stops meaning anything.
- `python3 -m flake8` is the lint gate (`.flake8`, defect checks only —
  layout is deliberately not gated). It runs in CI on every push.
- Full regression after any change: rebuild interpreters
  (`build_interpreters.sh` in the parent workspace), run the tier 0-5
  parity suite plus `tests/parity/synthtools_acceptance.py`, and the LVGL
  smoke test.
- See `docs/porting-plan.md`'s "Testing strategy" section for the complete
  methodology.
- **The parity/oracle gates are workspace-local by design.** They need
  built interpreters (`bin/circuitpython`, the workspace MicroPython) and
  golden captures that live outside this repository, so external
  contributors cannot run them and CI does not try. **Since 2026-09-03 the
  scripts' zero-argument defaults no longer point into `cmods/`** — a
  standalone user should not be steered into a directory only this
  workspace has — so in *this* workspace every parity command needs the
  explicit `--micropython`/`--circuitpython`/`--oracle` (or `CP_DIR`,
  `MP_UNIX`, `ULAB_DIR`) override shown above. Run one bare and it does not
  fail loudly: `verify_dsp.py` prints `skipping micropython (not built at
  ...)` and carries on with whatever is left. That is not a pass. What CI
  covers instead is what needs only the wheel: the CPython fixture tests in
  `tests/test_cpython_*.py` and the four in-repo parity gates
  (`verify_acceptance`, `verify_effects`, `verify_streaming`,
  `verify_biquad`), whose goldens are committed here. The component
  contract tests (`test_audio_component_api`, `test_metadata_contract`,
  `tools/validate_api.py`) went to audiocomponents with the packages they
  check.
- **Two kinds of golden, two rules (Brad, 2026-09-03).** The instruments
  digests — `instruments_*.json`, now under audiocomponents'
  `tests/parity/golden/` — record that *the port matches the pre-rewrite
  original script, within one interpreter*: `run_instruments_parity.py`
  there renders the originals from micropython-vst3 at `DEFAULT_OLD_REV` and
  never consults the CircuitPython oracle. So a change to `src/cpython/`
  *here* that is *right* still stales those cpython digests (audioif#25:
  `b420dac` did exactly this). Rule: a CPython-target fix may re-capture the
  affected cpython digests **only if it carries independent evidence against
  the built oracle** — a test in `tests/test_cpython_*.py` run against
  `bin/circuitpython` and cited in the message. The digests living in the
  other repository changes only the mechanics: the audiocomponents
  re-capture names the audioif commit that carries that evidence. A fix that
  merely *asserts* oracle intent does not qualify; that would let it rewrite
  its own reference. The accuracy program's *listening* goldens
  (audiocomponents) are a different authority — Brad's ear — and move only
  at his phrase. The stored digest is also the only thing in that gate that
  notices the engine moving under both original and port — which is why it
  stays: a live original-vs-port comparison was measured, approved and then
  reversed the same day (audioif#26), because it would have stayed green
  through `b420dac`. Each alarm costs one adjudication; that is the price of
  the signal.

## The CircuitPython oracle — extend, never modify

`cmods/circuitpython` (sibling checkout, detached at tag `10.2.1`) is the
**oracle** every parity golden is measured against. The rule, for any agent
working here:

- **Never edit files in `cmods/circuitpython` directly**, and never commit,
  pull, or move its pin. A modified oracle silently redefines what "parity"
  means and invalidates every golden without failing anything.
- **Extending CircuitPython is fine and is the designed path**: new modules
  live in this repo under `src/circuitpython_spike/`, and
  `apply_cp_patches.sh` copies them (plus `src/shared/` DSP) into the CP
  tree. The script is **additive-only by design** — it adds files and
  registers them in build glue; the sole stock-file rewrite it performs is
  the fenced audiocore `'B'`-memoryview patch. Do not add non-additive
  rewrites to it: `cmods/build_cp.sh` auto-applies the script before
  building `bin/circuitpython`, so a behavioral rewrite would leak *into*
  the oracle.
- Fixes to bugs that also exist upstream go in **this repo's targets only**
  (MicroPython/CPython/`src/shared/`), recorded in `docs/upstream-diff.md`
  — never into the CP tree. Approved deviations from the oracle are
  enumerated there; **ask before adding one**.
- Quick self-check after any CP-adjacent work:
  `CP_DIR=../cmods/circuitpython ./apply_cp_patches.sh --status` must account
  for every difference (bare, the script no longer finds the tree here and
  says `CircuitPython tree not found (set CP_DIR)`), and
  `git -C ../cmods/circuitpython status` must show only the known additive
  set (new module dirs, build glue, the fenced audiocore rewrite) — no
  changes under `shared-module/`/`shared-bindings/` for `synthio`,
  `audiofilters`, `audiocore` (beyond the fence), `audiomixer`, or
  `audiodelays`.
