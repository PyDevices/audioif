"""What a render pulls audio from, and how it tells them the time.

A *voice* is anything a render can drive: it takes the events
:mod:`audiorender.events` builds and hands back frames.

:class:`Voice` is that protocol over an :mod:`audioinstruments` instrument,
which is what a caller wants unless it has its own way of loading a sound -
a plug-in host driving its own script runner, say. Keeping the protocol
this small is what lets such a host reuse the render loop without reusing
the loader.
