"""The block render loop: a composition in, a mixed master out.

Rendering happens a block at a time, and every block does the same three
things in the same order - move the transport to the head of the block,
deliver every event that falls inside it, then pull the block. Events are
delivered with the block's own start as their sample position, which is
what a plug-in host does; an instrument that resolves sample positions
finer than a block sees the same thing here as it does there.
