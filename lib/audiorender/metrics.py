"""What a finished render is worth looking at.

Levels rather than waveforms: which track carries which section, whether
the climax is actually the loudest thing in the piece, whether the master
clips, how many voices are alive at once. These are the numbers a render
is checked against - a bounce through a real host is compared section by
section with them, so their arithmetic is part of the contract.

numpy only, and generously: this is the offline tier.
