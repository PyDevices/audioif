"""Beats to seconds and back, through a piecewise-constant tempo map.

A tempo map is a list of rows, each ``(beat, bpm)`` or
``(beat, bpm, ts_numerator, ts_denominator)``, giving the tempo in force
from that beat until the next row. The first row starts at beat 0.

Both directions are exact rather than incremental: a render walks the map
for every block, and accumulating seconds block by block would drift.
