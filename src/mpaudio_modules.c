// Module skeleton for audioif (tier 0 / phase 2 of
// docs/porting-plan.md): registers the top-level modules the port will
// grow into, each currently empty (just __name__). Each tier fills in its
// module's globals table directly in this file as ported classes/functions
// land -- so `import <name>` succeeds from the start of a tier's work, and
// this file's history is the port's tier-by-tier progress.
//
// This is new code (not a CircuitPython port): CircuitPython doesn't need
// an explicit module-registration file since its module tables are wired
// through its own build-time manifest system instead of MP_REGISTER_MODULE.

// audiodynamics / audioroute (tier 6) are the first modules here that are not
// CircuitPython ports at all -- they come from micropython-vst3's `vstaudio`
// usermod. See audiodynamics/module.c, audioroute/module.c.
