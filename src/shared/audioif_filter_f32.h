// Runtime-neutral float32 filter kernels: an RBJ biquad and a first-order
// all-pass cascade, both of which reach exact zero when the signal stops.
//
// New code -- not a CircuitPython port, and not from vstaudio either. It sits
// beside two frozen integer kernels that do the same jobs and cannot do this
// one:
//
//   * `shared/audioif_biquad.c` keeps its output memory in Q12 sample units
//     (`AUDIOIF_BIQUAD_STATE_SHIFT`) and rounds to nearest with no dither and
//     no leak term, so the recursion can land on a state that reproduces
//     itself exactly. Measured on audioif#23: `LowPass` 100 Hz parks at +1
//     LSB, `LowPass` 40 Hz q=8 at -4 LSB and the `Phaser` defaults at -4 LSB,
//     held for 3000 blocks / 32 s of silence.
//   * `shared/audioif_phaser.c` has its own version of the same defect in its
//     own arithmetic: `allpass_words[]` is `int16_t` in plain sample units
//     (`:28-38`), so the cascade settles on a non-zero word and holds it --
//     -6 LSB at the shipped `audioeffects.Phaser` settings. Fixing the biquad
//     would not move it, which is why one module carries both kernels.
//
// Neither frozen kernel is touched. Both are CircuitPython-ported code, and
// the port's rule is extend, never modify: an argument or an arithmetic
// change on audioif's copy of a CircuitPython module would not exist on a
// stock board, so a class written against it would silently be a different
// effect there. This is a new module instead, which either installs whole or
// is absent and says so on import.
//
// What float buys, precisely: with `float` state and a flush of any state
// word below AUDIOIF_FILTER_F32_FLUSH, a decaying tail reaches **exact zero**
// in finite time and silence in gives silence out for ever. That is the
// "Tier 1 silence" invariant every EQ, filter and phaser class in
// audiocomponents is held to. The second thing this carries, and the reason
// the all-pass is here rather than a patch to the biquad, is an **unclamped**
// feedback: `audiofilters/Phaser.c:211` limits it to 0.1..0.9, so a phaser
// built on the ported node can never reach the feedback-free topology the
// script pedals use, and its notches stop 17 dB short of a true null.
//
// The pulling loop is not here, for the same reason it is not in
// audioif_dynamics.c or audioif_feedback_delay.c: each runtime reaches its
// audio graph differently.
