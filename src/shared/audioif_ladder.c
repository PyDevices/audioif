// Runtime-neutral transistor ladder filter. See audioif_ladder.h for what the
// palette could not reach and why.
//
// `float` working precision, deliberately, to match audioif_dynamics.c and
// audioif_feedback_delay.c: this runs per sample on parts without an FPU at
// all, and doubles would cost more than the last few bits are worth.
//
// Two decisions are worth the space, because they are what make the filter a
// ladder rather than a resonant low-pass that looks like one.
//
// **The feedback has no delay in it.** Each stage is a topology-preserving
// (bilinear) one-pole, so four of them reach exactly -180 degrees at exactly
// the cutoff, with a gain of exactly 1/4 -- and the loop therefore sustains
// at a feedback of exactly 4, at exactly the cutoff, and not before. Put one
// sample of delay in the feedback path, which is the obvious way to write
// this, and none of those three sentences survives: the extra phase moves the
// 180-degree point below the cutoff, where each stage is louder, so the loop
// sustains early. Measured on the first draft of this file at 1 kHz and
// 48 kHz, it sustained at a feedback of 3.5, six percent below the cutoff --
// and worse the higher the cutoff goes, since the delay's phase is a fixed
// fraction of the sample rate while the filter's is not. "Self-oscillates at
// 4, at the cutoff" is the whole reason this node exists, so the loop is
// solved instead of delayed.
//
// **Solving it costs no division and no branch on the signal.** The loop
// equation is y + a*sat(y) = c, with a = resonance * g^4 and c everything
// the chain would output with the feedback disconnected. Where |y| >= 1 the
// saturator is constant and the equation is linear, so that branch is exact
// and closed-form. Inside, sat(y) = y - y^3/3 exactly, and the equation
// rearranges to y = (c + a*y^3/3)/(1 + a) -- a map whose derivative is
// a*y^2/(1+a), which is below 1 for every a and every |y| <= 1. So a fixed
// number of passes converges from any seed, with two precomputed constants
// and three multiplies a pass. Seeded by extrapolating the last two solved
// samples, four passes leave the residue far below the noise floor of the
// int16 the result is written back into.
