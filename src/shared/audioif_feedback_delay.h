// Runtime-neutral feedback delay with everything a repeat needs inside the
// loop: a low-pass, a high-pass, a soft-clip, per-sample delay modulation,
// and a cross-feed between the channels.
//
// New code -- not a CircuitPython port, and not from vstaudio either.
// `audiodelays.Echo` exists upstream and has none of it: its feedback path is
// `echo * decay` and nothing else. Everything a delay is actually *called*
// falls out of what happens in that path, so without it there is one delay
// with a level knob:
//
//   * **Tape.** Each pass through a tape machine loses top and bottom and
//     softens, so the repeats darken and blur into the reverb tail. Filtering
//     the whole wet signal once, after the delay, is not the same thing at
//     all -- it darkens the first repeat as much as the tenth.
//   * **Analog / BBD.** The same, further: a bucket-brigade line is noisy and
//     band-limited by construction, and its clock drifts.
//   * **Ping-pong.** Repeats alternating between the speakers needs each
//     channel's output fed into the *other* channel's line. Panning two taps
//     hard left and right, which is all the palette could do before, gives
//     two independent delays that happen to sit either side.
//
// The delay modulation is per sample rather than per block, which is the
// second thing upstream cannot reach: an LFO-driven `delay_ms` updates once
// per buffer, about 187 Hz at 48 kHz, so it steps rather than glides and the
// doppler that makes tape wow sound like tape is not there.
//
// Four later options, every one of them off by default, so a node built the
// way it was before them renders the same bytes (tests/parity's `wow`,
// `everything` and every other existing case are unchanged across them):
//
//   * **`wow_shape`.** The modulation was a sine and only a sine. A bucket
//     brigade's delay is its line length over twice its clock, so a triangle
//     on the *clock* -- the Small Clone -- arrives as a reciprocal on the
//     delay, which no sine is. The shape is one period of int16 Q15 the
//     caller computes in Python; C keeps a phase accumulator and looks it up.
//   * **`delay_slew`.** A change of `delay_ms` used to land in one jump, read
//     unsmoothed, which is a click on the block boundary and no pitch bend at
//     all. With a slew the read head walks to the new time at a constant
//     rate, which is a constant pitch offset for exactly as long as the move
//     lasts -- an Echoplex's varispeed, and the reason a delay-time knob can
//     be turned while something is playing.
//   * **`wow_am_depth`.** The wow oscillator on the wet gain as well as on
//     the delay, dipping only, never boosting, and outside the loop.
//   * **`loop_semitones`.** The line read pitch-shifted *inside* the loop, by
//     two taps half a window apart under a triangular crossfade, so every
//     pass rises again. That is a shimmer, and no arrangement of the existing
//     nodes is one: `audiodelays.PitchShift` after a delay shifts the sum of
//     every repeat once, not each repeat one more time.
//
// The pulling loop is not here, for the same reason it is not in
// audioif_dynamics.c: each runtime reaches its audio graph differently.
