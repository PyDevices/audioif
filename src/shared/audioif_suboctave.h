// Runtime-neutral analog-style octave divider: the Boss OC-2's front end,
// which is a comparator into a chain of flip-flops and nothing more.
//
// New code -- not a CircuitPython port, and not from vstaudio either. Nothing
// in the palette divides a *frequency*:
//
//   * **`audiodelays.PitchShift`** is granular. It resamples grains and
//     crossfades them, so an octave down arrives with the smear and the comb
//     that windowing costs, and it costs a grain buffer per instance. That is
//     a pitch shifter; a divider pedal is not one, and does not sound like
//     one.
//   * **`audiospeed.SpeedChanger`** moves the whole stream in time. An octave
//     down there is the take played at half speed, which is not an effect a
//     player can perform through.
//   * **`audiomath.Multiply`** rings the signal against a *free-running*
//     table. Multiplying by a square that is not locked to the input is a ring
//     modulator, and the sum and difference tones are exactly what a divider
//     must not produce.
//
// What an analog divider does instead is trivially cheap and has no window at
// all: square the input up with a comparator, halve that square with a
// flip-flop, and multiply the *original* signal by the halved square, which
// -- the square being +/-1 -- is a negate. The output is the input with every
// other cycle inverted, so its period is two input periods and its timbre is
// the input's, tracked sample by sample with zero latency. Two flip-flops in
// series give two octaves down.
//
// The comparator has hysteresis (a Schmitt trigger) and the clock has a
// re-trigger lockout, and both are there for the same reason the hardware has
// them: a guitar's waveform crosses zero more than twice per period as soon
// as the second harmonic is anywhere near the fundamental, and a divider that
// counts those extra crossings drops an octave too far and warbles. The
// hysteresis rejects the crossings near zero; the lockout rejects the ones
// that are big but too soon.
//
// The pulling loop is not here, for the same reason it is not in
// audioif_multiply.c: each runtime reaches its audio graph differently, so
// the bindings own the loop and call in with runs of frames.
