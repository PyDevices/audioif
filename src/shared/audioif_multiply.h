// Runtime-neutral sample-wise multiply: two audio streams multiplied
// together, which is ring modulation and, with a modulator that does not
// cross zero, amplitude modulation.
//
// New code -- not a CircuitPython port, and not from vstaudio either. Nothing
// upstream multiplies two *streams*: synthio rings a note against an
// oscillator, which cannot reach a microphone, a sampler, or the output of
// another effect. It is also the only way to modulate at audio rate on this
// palette, since an LFO-driven parameter updates once per block (about
// 187 Hz at 48 kHz) and a ring modulator wants hundreds of hertz.
//
// The pulling loop is not here, for the same reason it is not in
// audioif_dynamics.c: each runtime reaches its audio graph differently, so
// the bindings own the loop and call in with runs of frames.
