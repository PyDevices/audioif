// Runtime-neutral partitioned convolution: an impulse response, applied
// properly, at a cost that does not grow with its length the way the naive
// sum does.
//
// New code -- there is nothing like it in CircuitPython or in vstaudio. It is
// the one effect on the catalogue that cannot be approximated by the others:
// a plate emulation is a network of delays that *sounds like* a plate, while
// a convolution of a plate's recorded impulse *is* that plate, and the same
// goes for a guitar cabinet, a stairwell, or a spring tank someone measured.
//
// **Uniform-partitioned overlap-save.** The impulse is cut into partitions of
// AUDIOIF_CONVOLVE_FRAMES taps, each transformed once at load time. Every
// block, the input's transform is pushed into a frequency-delay line and the
// output is the sum of that line against the stored partitions, multiplied
// bin by bin. Direct convolution costs one multiply per tap per sample; this
// costs two transforms plus one complex multiply-accumulate per bin per
// partition, which for a one-second impulse at 48 kHz is roughly forty times
// less arithmetic.
//
// **One partition of latency, and it is unavoidable here.** A block cannot be
// transformed until it is complete, so the output lags the input by
// AUDIOIF_CONVOLVE_FRAMES frames -- 5.3 ms at 48 kHz. Removing it means a
// non-uniform partitioning scheme (a few direct taps, then small partitions,
// then large) which roughly triples the code for a saving that matters only
// when monitoring a live player. Deliberately not done. A reverb or a cabinet
// in a mix does not care, and neither does an offline render.
//
// **What it costs in memory**, which is what decides whether an impulse fits
// on a microcontroller at all: each partition holds
// (AUDIOIF_CONVOLVE_FRAMES + 1) complex floats, so about 2 KB, and there is
// one frequency-delay line per audio channel plus one stored impulse per
// impulse channel. A 4096-tap (85 ms) mono impulse over stereo audio is
// therefore around 100 KB. A one-second impulse is 1.2 MB and belongs on a
// desktop or a board with PSRAM. audioif_convolve_float_count() is the exact
// answer; there is no allocation in here.
//
// The pulling loop is not here, for the same reason it is not in
// audioif_dynamics.c: each runtime reaches its audio graph differently.
