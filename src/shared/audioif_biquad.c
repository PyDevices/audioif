// --- CircuitPython's own Q15 biquad ---------------------------------------
//
// See audioif_biquad.h for why this exists beside the widened kernel above:
// audioif#77, Brad 2026-09-09. Upstream nodes run this so they render
// CircuitPython's bytes; `audiobiquad`, which is ours, runs the widened one.
//
// It tracks CircuitPython **main**, not the 10.3.0 tag, in two places -- both
// bugs upstream has already merged fixes for (PRs from this project), neither
// of them yet in a release:
//
//   * PEAKING_EQ's `b2` is `1 - alpha * A`. 10.3.0 has the plus, which makes a
//     +6 dB bell at 1 kHz / Q 1 come out roughly +21 dB at DC. Fixed by
//     8fabdbbfb1 on main.
//   * `audioif_biquad_reset()` clears all four state words. 10.3.0 clears only
//     `x`, so a reset filter carries on recursing on the previous audio. Fixed
//     by 8a3deace5c on main.
//
// So this is CircuitPython's arithmetic as CircuitPython now intends it. Two
// named departures from the pinned 10.3.0 oracle follow from that, and both
// expire when upstream cuts a release containing those commits.
//
// What is NOT corrected here, deliberately, is the Q15 coefficient format and
// `fast_sincos`. That is `biquad-band-edges`, the one report still open
// upstream, and it is the whole reason the widened kernel above exists.

// CircuitPython's fast_sincos: one 5th-order fit to both sine and cosine over
// [0, pi/2], evaluated wherever W0 lands -- no reflection, so above pi/2 (12
// kHz at 48 kHz) it is extrapolating. Reproduced as written, extrapolation
// included; audioif_sincos_reflect() is the corrected one and is not this.
