// Runtime-neutral table-driven waveshaper with oversampling.
//
// New code -- not a CircuitPython port, and not from vstaudio either. What
// the palette has instead is `audiofilters.Distortion`, and two things about
// it put every drive circuit out of reach:
//
//   * **The curve is not yours.** Its whole argument list is `drive`,
//     `pre_gain`, `post_gain`, `mode`, `soft_clip` and `mix`
//     (audioif_distortion.c:6-8), and `mode` picks one of four fixed shapes
//     written for a game engine. A diode pair in a feedback loop, diodes to
//     ground, a biased germanium transistor: each is a specific curve, and
//     none of the four is any of them. Two of the four (CLIP and WAVESHAPE)
//     are odd-symmetric by construction, so they cannot make an even
//     harmonic at all, and CLIP is `pow(fabs(value), drive)` with the sign
//     put back -- homogeneous, so its harmonic profile is the same at -20
//     dBFS as at -6 dBFS. A circuit's is not.
//   * **It runs at the base rate.** A nonlinearity makes harmonics above
//     Nyquist and they fold back onto the signal. Measured on the shipped
//     Fuzz setting, a 1010 Hz sine through CLIP puts its non-harmonic energy
//     19.6 dB below the fundamental -- 40 dB short of the 60 dB the drive
//     dossiers ask for. (Probe at 1000 Hz instead and it reads -319 dB,
//     because at that frequency every alias lands back on a harmonic: an
//     absence that reads as agreement.) Nothing else in the palette
//     resamples either; `audiospeed.SpeedChanger` steps `phase >>
//     SPEED_SHIFT` with no interpolation and no anti-alias filter, and is
//     itself a CircuitPython port.
//
// So: the curve arrives as data -- an int16 Q15 table computed once on
// CPython, where the dossier can show the circuit maths that produced it,
// and never rebuilt on the target, whose float is single-precision where the
// desktop's is double -- and the shaping happens at 2x, 4x or 8x the sample
// rate between a matched pair of half-band filters.
//
// The half-bands are two-path polyphase all-pass cascades rather than FIRs,
// deliberately: an FIR half-band steep enough for this transition costs tens
// of taps and half of them again of group delay, and this node is meant to be
// usable in a live signal path. The all-pass pair is minimum-phase and costs
// one multiply per section per sample. What it is not is free: measured on
// the built extension (a 200 Hz..5 kHz sine, output phase against input, at
// 48 kHz), the whole up/shape/down chain's group delay is 0 samples at 1x,
// 2.2 samples (46 us) at 2x, 3.3 (69 us) at 4x and 3.9 (80 us) at 8x, and
// the magnitude response over 200 Hz..18 kHz is flat to within 0.001 dB.
// It is not an integer and it is not zero, so a class reporting
// `latency_samples` should report the figure for the factor it built with
// rather than assume either.
//
// The optional hysteresis is a *play* (backlash) operator in front of the
// table: the one thing a table cannot do is enclose an area. A static curve's
// output depends only on its present input, so a slow triangle in and out
// traces the same path twice and encloses exactly nothing -- which is the
// disconfirmation condition of Saturation's TP3 met a priori, without a
// measurement. The operator gives the table a position that lags the input by
// a half-width, so the rising and falling branches separate.
//
// The pulling loop is not here, for the same reason it is not in
// audioif_dynamics.c: each runtime reaches its audio graph differently.
