// Runtime-neutral transistor ladder filter: four one-pole stages round a
// global feedback loop with an odd saturator inside the loop.
//
// New code -- not a CircuitPython port, and not from vstaudio either. The
// palette could not reach it, and the gap is not a matter of degree:
//
//   * `audiofilters.Filter` cascades two RBJ biquads. It tracks the analytic
//     resonance of this filter to within a fraction of a dB at every
//     resonance short of self-oscillation -- and it is LINEAR, so from
//     silence it stays silent however far the resonance is pushed. A ladder's
//     defining behaviour is that it does not: at a feedback of 4 the loop
//     sustains a tone of its own, and what stops that tone growing without
//     bound is the saturator inside the loop, which is also where the growl
//     comes from.
//   * Nothing else in the palette closes a loop of the right shape. An
//     audioif graph is a pull DAG in which no node accepts its own output, so
//     a loop exists only inside one C kernel. `audioecho`'s loop is
//     `echo * decay + sample` into a delay line -- one tap, no filter in the
//     path (audioif_echo.c:24, :31). `audioecho.FeedbackDelay`'s loop is a
//     comb: its resonances are harmonics of 1/delay, not one movable cutoff.
//     And a loop closed in Python runs at block rate, 187 Hz at 48 kHz,
//     which is 2.4 orders of magnitude too slow to be a filter at all.
//
// The pulling loop is not here, for the same reason it is not in
// audioif_dynamics.c or audioif_feedback_delay.c: each runtime reaches its
// audio graph differently.
