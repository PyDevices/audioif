// Runtime-neutral mid/side matrix: a stereo pair decomposed into its mono sum
// and its difference, the difference scaled, and the pair rebuilt.
//
// New code -- not a CircuitPython port, and not from vstaudio either. Nothing
// upstream widens or narrows a stereo image. `audiomixer.Mixer` has a per-
// voice `pan`, which places a source between the speakers; it cannot reach
// what is already *between* them, and no amount of panning collapses a stereo
// pair to mono or pushes its sides out.
//
// The node exists for the drive classes rather than for stereo width alone.
// A saturator, a fuzz or an overdrive is a nonlinearity, and a nonlinearity
// applied to a stereo pair intermodulates the two channels: the sides come
// back as sum-and-difference products of both. Splitting to mid and side,
// driving the mid, and rebuilding is how a stereo drive keeps its image --
// and it is the only shape in which `audioroute.Splitter`'s parallel branches
// can carry a mid and a side rather than two copies of the same stereo pair.
//
// The pulling loop is not here, for the same reason it is not in
// audioif_multiply.c: each runtime reaches its audio graph differently, so
// the bindings own the loop and call in with runs of frames.
