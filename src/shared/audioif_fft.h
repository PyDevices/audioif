// Real-input FFT, in float, with the twiddle tables handed in rather than
// allocated. New code -- nothing upstream in CircuitPython transforms
// anything, and vstaudio never did either.
//
// Everything here exists to serve audioif_convolve.c, so the shape is the
// one partitioned convolution wants: real blocks of N samples in, N/2 + 1
// complex bins out, and back. It is a plain radix-2 Cooley-Tukey with a
// bit-reversal pass; there is no attempt at a split-radix or a hand-unrolled
// first stage, because the honest bottleneck in a convolver is the pointwise
// multiply across the partitions, not the two transforms either side of it.
//
// **Float, not double.** A double transform would double the memory of every
// stored partition, which is the thing that decides whether an impulse
// response fits on a microcontroller at all. float32 gives about 7 digits and
// the transform's error grows as sqrt(log2 N), so a 512-point transform of
// int16 audio lands ~1e-3 out of a full-scale 32768 -- five orders of
// magnitude below the samples it is made of.
//
// **The twiddles come from audioif_sincos(), not libm**, for the reason given
// in audioif_trig.h: a golden hash of a probe has to match on all three
// interpreters, and three libms do not agree in the last place. They are
// computed once, at init.
