// Runtime-neutral algorithmic reverberation tank: Dattorro's plate topology,
// with the line-length table and the output taps handed in from Python.
//
// New code -- not a CircuitPython port, and not from vstaudio either.
// `audiofreeverb.Freeverb` is the only reverberation network the palette had,
// and it is a *fixed* Schroeder/Moorer comb-and-all-pass bank: its line
// lengths are constants inside a CircuitPython-ported binding
// (`audioif_freeverb.c`), there are no modulated taps, no dispersive input
// chain, and no way to re-cut the topology per character. So one thing the
// palette could not do at all:
//
//   * **Re-tune the network.** A plate, a hall, a room and a chamber are not
//     one topology at four mix settings; they are different line-length sets
//     and different tap positions. Freeverb's are compiled in.
//   * **Recirculate at all, from Python.** Composing a tank out of palette
//     nodes needs a *cycle* in the pull graph, and there is none to be had:
//     `d1.play(s); d2.play(d1); d1.play(d2)` constructs happily and the first
//     `get_buffer(d1)` raises `RecursionError`. The only Python-side loop
//     quantises every line to one 256-frame block (5.33 ms at 48 kHz), longer
//     than most of a plate's lines.
//   * **Modulate the tank's own all-passes.** The picket-fence ringing of a
//     static plate is broken by wobbling the first all-pass in each half by a
//     fraction of a millisecond. Nothing outside the loop can reach it.
//
// `audiofreeverb` is untouched by this module: it is CircuitPython's, and a
// new module either installs whole or is absent and says so on import.
//
// The pulling loop is not here, for the same reason it is not in
// audioif_feedback_delay.c: each runtime reaches its audio graph differently.
