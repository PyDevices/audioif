"""Rewrites inside CircuitPython's own sources that apply_cp_patches.sh makes.

    apply_replacements.py <circuitpython dir> apply|dry-run|status

Everything else that script does is additive - new files, new lines in a build
list - and marker comments are enough to make those idempotent. What lives here
is the one place audioif has to change code CircuitPython already had, which
needs a before as well as an after.

Each rewrite is idempotent, and fails loudly rather than quietly when neither
the marker nor the original text is present: that means the file moved
underneath us upstream and a person should look at it.

#: audiocore.get_buffer handed back a memoryview typed by the sample's width,
#: so len() counted samples while the C protocol's buffer_length counts bytes.
#: Every byte calculation downstream was then wrong by the sample width - a
#: silent 2x for ordinary 16-bit audio. audioif's own audiocore returns a byte
#: view; this makes the oracle agree, so parity captures compare like with
