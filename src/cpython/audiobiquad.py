"""A biquad and a first-order all-pass cascade that reach exact zero.

Not a CircuitPython module, and not from micropython-vst3's engine either --
audioif adds it. `audiofilters.Filter` (over `synthio.Biquad`) and
`audiofilters.Phaser` already do these two jobs, and both are ported
CircuitPython whose arithmetic is integer:

- `synthio.Biquad`'s recursion keeps its output memory in Q12 sample units
  and rounds to nearest, with no dither and no leak, so it can land on a
  state that reproduces itself. Fed silence after a burst, a `LowPass` at
  100 Hz holds +1 LSB, a `LowPass` at 40 Hz q=8 holds -4 LSB and the
  `Phaser` defaults hold -4 LSB -- measured to 3000 blocks, 32 seconds of
  audio, and they never decay (audioif#23).
- `audiofilters.Phaser` has the same defect in its own kernel: its all-pass
  memory is `int16_t` in plain sample units, so it settles on a non-zero
  word and holds it. It also clamps `feedback` to 0.1..0.9, so the
  feedback-free topology every script phaser uses is not reachable and the
  notches stop about 17 dB short of a null.

Neither is modified -- audioif's rule for ported code is extend, never
modify, because an argument on this port's copy of a CircuitPython module
would not exist on a stock board. This module is the extension:

    eq = audiobiquad.Biquad(mode=audiobiquad.PEAKING_EQ, frequency=3200,
                            Q=1.2, gain_db=-4.0, sample_rate=48000)
    eq.play(source)

    phase = audiobiquad.AllPass(stages=4, frequency=sweep, feedback=0.0,
                                mix=0.5, sample_rate=48000)
    phase.play(eq)

`frequency`, `Q`, `gain_db`, `feedback` and `mix` all accept a synthio
`BlockInput` -- an `LFO`, a `Math`, or a plain number -- read once per
processed chunk, exactly as `audiofilters.Filter` reads its own.

Two things this does that the ported nodes cannot:

- **Silence in, silence out.** State is `float`, and any state word below
  1e-20 is written as exact zero, so a tail decays to zero and stays there.
- **`feedback=0.0` is zero**, and negative feedback is allowed. At zero an
  `AllPass` cascade at `mix=0.5` is the script phaser's equal sum, and its
  notches are true nulls.

And one convenience: `AllPass`'s `frequency` really is the frequency at
which one stage's phase passes -90 degrees, because the coefficient is the
bilinear `(tan(pi f / fs) - 1) / (tan(pi f / fs) + 1)`.
`audiofilters.Phaser` uses the small-angle form of that, which lands the
break high enough to matter, so its class has to pre-warp in Python.
