"""Route audio: fan one stream out to parallel branches, or move it between
the channels.

Unlike the rest of this package, `audioroute` is not a CircuitPython module.
`Splitter` comes from micropython-vst3's `vstaudio` engine, where the effects
library's exciters, Haas wideners and multiband splits are built on it.
`MidSide` is audioif's own and has no ancestor anywhere: it turns a stereo
pair into its mono sum and its difference, scales the difference, and rebuilds
the pair, which is how a stereo drive keeps its image and the only way this
palette collapses a pair to mono or pushes its sides out.

    split = audioroute.Splitter(source, taps=3)
    low.play(split.tap(0))
    mid.play(split.tap(1))
    high.play(split.tap(2))
    mixer.play(low, voice=0) ...

Every tap reads the same stream at its own pace over a shared ring. Whichever
one is pulled first refills the ring; the others read what it wrote. A branch
that nobody reads must not wedge the ring, so writing past a laggard's cursor
drags it forward: that branch skips ahead rather than stalling the graph.
