"""Convolution: an impulse response applied properly, rather than imitated.

Not a CircuitPython module, and not from micropython-vst3's engine either --
audioif adds it. It is the one effect on the catalogue the others cannot
approximate. A plate emulation is a network of delays that *sounds like* a
plate; a convolution of a plate's recorded impulse *is* that plate. The same
node is a hall, a guitar cabinet, a spring tank or a telephone, depending only
on which impulse it was handed::

    cab = audioconvolve.Convolver(impulse=taps, max_taps=2048, mix=1.0)
    cab.play(source)
    audio_out.play(cab)

or, with no file to load::

    hall = audioconvolve.Convolver(max_taps=48000, ir_channels=2)
    hall.synthesize(decay=2.4, damping_hz=4000, predelay_ms=25,
                    diffusion_ms=12, seed=4)
    hall.set(mix=0.35)

`impulse` is int16 frames, interleaved if `impulse_channels` is 2. `max_taps`
sizes the convolver and cannot grow afterwards -- see the module docstring in
shared/audioif_convolve.h for what a partition costs, because on a
microcontroller that number decides whether an impulse fits at all.

**The output lags the input by `latency` frames** (one partition, 5.3 ms at
48 kHz). A block cannot be transformed before it is complete, and removing
that would mean a non-uniform partitioning scheme worth roughly triple the
code -- which matters only when monitoring a live player. A convolver with no
impulse loaded passes its input through with no latency at all: an impulse
that has not arrived is a missing setting, not a null room.
