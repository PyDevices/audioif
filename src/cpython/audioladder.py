"""A transistor ladder filter: four one-pole stages round a feedback loop
with an odd saturator inside the loop.

Not a CircuitPython module, and not from micropython-vst3's engine either --
audioif adds it. `audiofilters.Filter` reproduces a resonant low-pass, and
this is not a better one: it is the thing a cascade of biquads cannot be,
because a biquad cascade is linear and a ladder's character is what its
feedback loop's nonlinearity does.

    ladder = audioladder.Ladder(
        sample_rate=48000, cutoff_hz=800, resonance=3.6, drive=2.5)
    ladder.play(source)
    audio_out.play(ladder)

`resonance` is the classic 0..4 feedback: at 4 the loop sustains a tone of
its own, at the cutoff, from silence, and the saturator inside the loop is
what stops that tone growing without bound. Below 4 it is a resonant
low-pass whose peak sharpens as the number rises. `drive` is a linear gain
into the loop, so how hard the saturator is hit -- and therefore how much of
the growl there is -- follows the input level, the way it does in the
circuit. `poles` taps the output from the first, second, third or fourth
stage (6, 12, 18 or 24 dB an octave); the feedback is always the fourth, so
the resonance is the same filter's at every tap. `passband_comp` gives back
the passband the feedback subtracts, 0 for none (the default, which is what
the circuit does) and 1 for all of it. `oversample` runs the loop at twice
the rate so the harmonics the saturator makes fold back less; it is on by
default, because half the cost is the wrong saving on the one node whose job
is to distort. `mix` is a plain crossfade, 0 a wire and 1 the filter.

A module of its own rather than arguments on `audiofilters.Filter`,
deliberately: an argument added to audioif's copy of a CircuitPython module
would not exist on a stock board, so an effect written against it would
silently be a different effect there. This either installs whole or is absent
and says so on import.
