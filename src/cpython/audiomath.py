"""Arithmetic on audio streams: one multiplied by another, and one divided
down in frequency.

Unlike most of this package, `audiomath` is not a CircuitPython module and did
not come from micropython-vst3's engine either - audioif adds it. Nothing else
in the palette multiplies two *streams*: `synthio` rings a note against an
oscillator, which cannot reach a microphone, a sampler, or the output of
another effect, and an LFO-driven parameter updates once per block (about
187 Hz at 48 kHz) where a ring modulator wants hundreds of hertz.

    carrier = audiocore.RawSample(one_cycle_of_sine, sample_rate=48000,
                                  channel_count=2)
    node = audiomath.Multiply(source, carrier, mix=1.0)
    audio_out.play(node)

The two inputs fail in opposite directions, deliberately. A source that runs
dry gives silence, as every other effect here does; a modulator that is absent
or has stopped lets the signal through untouched, because multiplying by
nothing and multiplying by zero must not mean the same thing.

`SubOctave` is the other kind of arithmetic on one stream: a comparator into a
chain of flip-flops, which is the Boss OC-2's front end and every analog
divider's. It inverts every other cycle of the signal, so the result has twice
the period, the input's own timbre, and no latency at all:

    node = audiomath.SubOctave(source, order=1, mix=1.0)
    audio_out.play(node)

`audiodelays.PitchShift` also goes down an octave, but granularly - windowed
grains, a comb, and a buffer per instance. A divider is none of that, and does
not sound like it.
