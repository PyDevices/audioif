"""An algorithmic reverberation tank whose topology comes from Python.

Not a CircuitPython module, and not from micropython-vst3's engine either --
audioif adds it. `audiofreeverb.Freeverb` is the only reverberator upstream
has, and its line lengths are constants inside a CircuitPython-ported binding:
one topology, no modulated taps, no dispersive input chain, nothing to re-cut
per character. `audioverb.Tank` is Dattorro's plate network with the line
lengths and the output taps handed in::

    plate = audioverb.Tank(
        sample_rate=48000, max_predelay_ms=200, decay=0.7, diffusion=0.75,
        bandwidth_hz=9000, damping_hz=4500, mod_rate_hz=1.0,
        mod_depth_ms=0.27, mix=0.35)
    plate.play(source)
    audio_out.play(plate)

The signal path is Dattorro's: predelay, a one-pole `bandwidth_hz` band limit,
an optional `low_cut_hz` and `drive`, four Schroeder all-passes, then a tank of
two halves that feed each other. Each half is a *modulated* all-pass (a
fractional read wobbling by `mod_depth_ms` at `mod_rate_hz`, which is what
breaks a static plate's picket-fence ringing), a delay, a one-pole `damping_hz`
in the loop, the `decay` multiply, a second all-pass and another delay. The
stereo comes back out of the tap table, then `width`, `tone_db` and `mix`.

`delays` is twelve line lengths in frames, in this order::

    0..3    the four input diffusers
    4..7    tank half A: modulated all-pass, delay, all-pass, delay
    8..11   tank half B: the same four

`taps` is four values per tap -- channel, line index, offset in frames, gain --
and at most 32 of them. Both default to Dattorro's own published table, scaled
from 29761 Hz to whatever `sample_rate` says. His figures, for a class that
wants to scale or re-cut them itself:

    lines   142 107 379 277 | 672 4453 1800 3720 | 908 4217 2656 3163
    left    +.6 line9[266] +.6 line9[2974] -.6 line10[1913] +.6 line11[1996]
            -.6 line5[1990] -.6 line6[187] -.6 line7[1066]
    right   +.6 line5[353] +.6 line5[3627] -.6 line6[1228] +.6 line7[2673]
            -.6 line9[2111] -.6 line10[335] -.6 line11[121]

Every filter is off at zero -- `damping_hz`, `bandwidth_hz`, `low_cut_hz`,
`mod_rate_hz`, `mod_depth_ms`, `drive`, `tone_db`, `predelay_ms` -- so a bare
`Tank()` is that network with nothing added to it. `mix` follows
`audiodelays.Echo`'s 0..2 convention, dry at unity until 1, the same one
`audioecho.FeedbackDelay` adopted, so a rack built out of several of these
nodes has one meaning for the word.

A new module rather than arguments on `Freeverb`, deliberately: an argument
added to audioif's copy of a CircuitPython module would not exist on a stock
board, so an effect written against it would silently be a different effect
there. This either installs whole or is absent and says so on import.
