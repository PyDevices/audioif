"""Envelope-follower dynamics processing: compression, limiting, downward
expansion, gating and transient shaping.

Unlike the rest of this package, `audiodynamics` is not a CircuitPython module.
It comes from micropython-vst3's `vstaudio` engine, which grew it for its
effects library, and it is provided here for MicroPython, CPython and patched
CircuitPython alike.

    node = audiodynamics.Dynamics(
        audiodynamics.DYN_COMPRESS, sample_rate=48000,
        threshold_db=-24, ratio=4, knee_db=6, attack_ms=10, release_ms=120)
    node.play(source)          # any audiosample: 16-bit signed stereo
    audio_out.play(node)

`sidechain_hz` high-passes the detector without touching the audio, which is
how the de-essers in the effects library are built. `gain_reduction_db()`
reports what the last processed frame was reduced by, for a meter.

`lookahead_ms` holds the audio back while the detector reads ahead of it, so
the gain is already down by the time the peak arrives - the difference
between a brickwall limiter that catches transients and one that overshoots
them. It is latency the whole chain pays, capped at 50 ms, and it costs a
buffer that is allocated only if asked for. `true_peak=True` adds the peak
*between* samples to what the detector sees, which is where an inter-sample
over hides. Both default off: a Dynamics built without them is the node
exactly as it was.

Twenty-one further options came with the effects program, every one of them
default-off and every one of them a fixed trait of a named circuit that
tuning the shipped knobs cannot reach. See docs/upstream-diff.md for the
measurements; briefly:

* ``detector="rms"`` with ``rms_ms`` averages a mean square instead of
  rectifying a peak, so a sine and a square of equal RMS get the same gain.
* ``feedback_detector=True`` reads the frame the node last put out rather
  than this frame's input - the side chain tapped after the gain cell, as a
  1176, an LA-2A and a Fairchild all do. ``key(sample)`` feeds the detector
  from a different stream entirely, and ``key_listen=True`` puts the
  detector's own signal on the output.
* ``true_peak=2`` replaces the half-band estimate with a 4x polyphase
  reconstruction - four phases of twelve taps, BS.1770 Annex 2's shape,
  though not its coefficients - which reads a worst-phase tone within
  0.26 dB where the estimate under-reads by 1.24 dB at a quarter of the
  sample rate.
* ``sidechain_lp_hz`` puts the top on the key band ``sidechain_hz`` opened
  the bottom of, and ``sidechain_poles=2`` cascades a second pole through
  both, taking the skirt from 6 to 12 dB/octave.
* ``depth_db`` replaces the expander's fixed -60 dB and the gate's fixed
  -80 dB floors. Positive means unset, because a depth is an attenuation.
* ``hold_ms`` (with ``hysteresis_db``) swaps the gate's memoryless gain
  computer for a closed/attack/hold/decay machine: once the attack starts it
  runs to full open whatever the key does next, and holds there.
* ``relative_threshold=True`` drives the gain computer with the side-chained
  level minus the full-band level, so a fixed spectral balance gets the same
  reduction wherever it sits in the level range.
* ``program_attack=True`` scales the attack coefficient by the overshoot, so
  20 dB over is caught about three times faster than 10 dB over.
* ``transient_fast_attack_ms``, ``transient_fast_release_ms``,
  ``transient_slow_attack_ms`` and ``transient_slow_release_ms`` expose the
  transient shaper's four detector time constants, which were literals.
  ``slow_hold_ms`` makes the slow envelope a peak-hold, and
  ``transient_dual=True`` runs a second, slower pair
  (``sustain_fast_attack_ms`` and its three siblings) for the sustain
  section so both differences apply at once instead of one being selected.
