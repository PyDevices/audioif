## Unreleased

## v0.4.0 (2026-09-10)

Brings `synthio` and `audiomixer` up to CircuitPython 10.3.0, which moves
rendered audio: a pan control now works the other way round, and level changes
wait for a zero crossing. The comparison build is now made at the same version
and voice ceiling this port ships, which is what found those two changes and
retires the last ceiling deviation. See
[docs/correctness-standard.md](docs/correctness-standard.md).

### Breaking

- A released node raises `ValueError`, not `RuntimeError` on the CPython target.
  Same type and message as the native builds now. Code catching `RuntimeError`
  around a teardown path should be changed to `ValueError`. (#73)
- `synthio`, `audiomixer`: `panning > 0` attenuates the **left** channel.
  Upstream flipped `synthio.Note` to match `audiomixer.Mixer`; both were
  reversed here, so the direction of every pan is inverted. A patch or a
  composition that sets `panning` should have its sign flipped.
- `synthio`, `audiomixer`: a level, amplitude or pan change now waits for a zero
  crossing, so it cannot click. Delayed by at most one block.
- `synthio`: a voice at envelope level 0 renders nothing, as the native builds
  do. Previously it kept sounding at its previous loudness for up to a block.
  (#78)
- `synthio.Biquad`, and so `audiofilters.Filter`, runs CircuitPython's Q15
  arithmetic on all three targets. `audiobiquad` keeps the widened kernel. The
  deviation had been applied on one target only, 11 LSB apart by the eighth
  sample of an 800 Hz low-pass. (#77) — **use `audiobiquad` below 100 Hz**, see
  [which filter to reach for](docs/upstream-diff.md#which-filter-to-reach-for)
- `audiobiquad`: transposed direct form II. 7 of 56 f0/Q cells outside 0.05 dB
  becomes 1, at no measurable cost. (#64)

### Added

- Every module of ours reports `__version__` and `__revision__`, so a firmware
  can name the audioif it was built from. A published wheel reports `unknown`
  for the revision -- it is built from an sdist with no `.git`, and its
  `__version__` already names it exactly. (#55)
- `audiodelays.Flanger`, `audiodelays.GranularPitchShift`, `audiospeed.Resampler`
  and the `audiofilters` filter chain on MicroPython, so all three targets carry
  CircuitPython 10.3.0's nodes. (#74)
- `audiodelays.Echo.filter`, `audiofreeverb.Freeverb.pre_filter`/`post_filter`.
- `audiodynamics`: `gain_smooth_ms`, a one-pole on the computed gain (#61), and
  `feedback_gain_corrected`, so a feedback loop lands on its ratio (#62). Both
  default off.
- `audioroute.MidSide`, and `audiomath.SubOctave` as an analog octave divider.
- `deinit()` on the twelve node types that had none, plus the deinitialised guard
  on the one funnel every pull goes through. (#58, #59, #60, #63)

### Fixed

- `audiodynamics`: the ESP32-P4 and ESP32-S3 rendered the transient attack path
  differently. Fused multiply-add, forbidden in that kernel; the two boards now
  agree byte for byte. (#66)
- `audiodynamics`: `reset()` clears the key filters, so a reset node is a fresh
  one. (#56)
- `audioconvolve.Convolver.latency` reports 0 when nothing is loaded. (#44)
- `audioecho.FeedbackDelay` renders mono correctly when a source block is short.
- `audioroute.Splitter` can be released, and releasing it releases its taps.
- `audiodelays.Flanger`: the wet interpolation overflowed `int32` on full-scale
  material. Upstream's still does. (#76)
- `audioeffects.Phaser` and `audioeffects.LowPass` return to exact silence.
  `audiofilters.Phaser` still holds DC. (#23, #36)
- The comparison build was made at a different CircuitPython version and voice
  ceiling than this port ships, so nothing above the mix-down knee could agree
  with it. It is now built at 10.3.0 at our own ceiling, and the 14 → 64
  deviation is retired rather than documented. (#27, #31)
- `biquad_component_probe` was graded against its own stored digest, so it could
  not see two of our own targets disagreeing. `verify_dsp` now compares the
  three interpreters.
- Nothing held the MicroPython and CircuitPython bindings to the same surface;
  three changes drifted in one day. `tests/test_binding_parity.py` does. (#75)
- Stored digests were a reference of record, and a digest can be re-blessed.
  Replaced by numeric traits with planted faults for every own node. See
  [docs/correctness-standard.md](docs/correctness-standard.md).

### Documentation

- [docs/correctness-standard.md](docs/correctness-standard.md): what audioif is
  held to, in one page.
- [docs/upstream-diff.md](docs/upstream-diff.md) records what CircuitPython's
  Q15 biquad does below 100 Hz, where `b0` rounds to zero, and which filter to
  reach for.
