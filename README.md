# audioif

CircuitPython's audio system for MicroPython and CPython — `audiocore`,
`audiomixer`, `synthio` (including `MidiTrack`), the effects modules
(`audiofilters`, `audiodelays`, `audiofreeverb`, `audiospeed`), `audiomp3`,
and CircuitPython `play()`/`stop()`/`pause()`/`resume()` output semantics.
Import names stay `audiocore`/`synthio`/etc., matching CircuitPython for
source compatibility.

## Installation

**MicroPython** consumes this repository as `USER_C_MODULES`, and it is
fully standalone for both build flavors — no other repository is required.
`./scripts/fetch_deps.sh` puts the two pinned native dependencies (`ulab`,
`mp3`) under `.deps/`, and both `micropython.mk` and `micropython.cmake`
look there first, falling back to a sibling checkout beside this repo and
otherwise failing the build with an error naming both paths.

For a CMake port (esp32, rp2), point `USER_C_MODULES` straight at this
checkout:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/PyDevices/audioif ~/build/audioif
cd ~/build/audioif && ./scripts/fetch_deps.sh
idf.py build -DUSER_C_MODULES=~/build/audioif
```

For a Make port (unix, windows, webassembly), MicroPython's own build glob
looks one level down, so point `USER_C_MODULES` at this checkout's
*parent* directory instead:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/PyDevices/audioif ~/build/audioif
cd ~/build/audioif && ./scripts/fetch_deps.sh
git clone https://github.com/micropython/micropython ~/build/micropython
cd ~/build/micropython/mpy-cross && make
cd ~/build/micropython/ports/unix && make submodules
make USER_C_MODULES=~/build
```

The two dependencies are `ulab` (so `synthtools`'s `import ulab.numpy`
works) and `mp3` (the `audiomp3` tier's decoder), pinned by
[DEPENDENCIES.lock](DEPENDENCIES.lock). To build without them, skip the
fetch and set `AUDIOIF_OPTIONAL_DEPS=1` on the **build** step instead — the
variable is read by `micropython.mk`/`micropython.cmake`, not by
`fetch_deps.sh`, and on CMake ports it is read as an *environment*
variable, not as a `-D` cache entry:

```sh
make USER_C_MODULES=~/build AUDIOIF_OPTIONAL_DEPS=1              # Make ports
AUDIOIF_OPTIONAL_DEPS=1 idf.py build -DUSER_C_MODULES=~/build/audioif   # CMake
```

That builds every module except `audiomp3` with no clone beyond this
repository; `synthtools`' `import ulab.numpy` then fails at runtime, which
is the trade the flag buys. See [docs/porting-plan.md](docs/porting-plan.md)
for the architecture, module tiers, phased plan, and testing strategy.

**CPython 3.10+** installs from TestPyPI:

```sh
python -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ pydevices-audioif
```

This gets you `audiocore`, `synthio`, `audiomixer`, `audiofilters`,
`audiodelays`, `audiofreeverb`, `audiospeed`, `audiodynamics`, `audioroute`,
`audiomath`, `audioecho`, `audioshaper`, `audioladder`, `audioconvolve`,
`audiobiquad`, `audioverb`, and the
`audiorender` package.
`audiomp3` remains firmware-only. The distribution declares no *required*
runtime dependencies and does not itself publish an `audioif` import; its
version is the `VERSION` file, which is also what `_audioif.__version__`
reports.

`audiorender` is the exception, and it is opt-in: it is numpy throughout,
so numpy comes with the `render` extra rather than with the wheel, keeping
the core dependency-free for boards and wasm. TestPyPI carries no usable
numpy, so the extra needs PyPI as a second index:

```sh
python -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ \
    --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ "pydevices-audioif[render]"
```

The instrument and effect libraries — `audioinstruments` (53 synthesizers,
keyboards and drum machines) and `audioeffects` (46 effect classes, racks
included) — are not part of this distribution. They live in the
[audiocomponents](https://github.com/PyDevices/audiocomponents) repository
as their own packages, each depending on `pydevices-audioif`; see that
repository for how to install them.

## What's here

One pure-Python tier sits on top of the CircuitPython-compatible core:

- **`lib/audiorender/`** — renders a whole composition offline: tracks,
  tempo map, notes and automation in, a mixed stereo master and a level
  report out. This is the one part of the repository written for a desktop
  rather than a board — numpy throughout, a whole song in memory — so it
  ships in the wheel and is never frozen into firmware. It has its own
  README.

The instrument and effect libraries that used to sit beside it —
`audioinstruments` and `audioeffects` — now live in the
[audiocomponents](https://github.com/PyDevices/audiocomponents) repository,
together with the audio component contract they implement: the metadata
manifest
([docs/audio-components.md](https://github.com/PyDevices/audiocomponents/blob/main/docs/audio-components.md))
and the runtime API
([docs/audio-component-api.md](https://github.com/PyDevices/audiocomponents/blob/main/docs/audio-component-api.md)).
`audiorender` drives any component that speaks that API and does not need
those packages installed.

## Additions beyond CircuitPython

Ten things here are not CircuitPython's. `audiodynamics` (compression,
limiting, expansion, gating, transient shaping) and `audioroute.Splitter`
(fan one stream out to parallel branches) come from micropython-vst3's audio
engine, which had them and CircuitPython does not. `audiomath` (multiply one
stream by another — ring and amplitude modulation; and divide one down in
frequency — the analog octave divider), `audioecho` (a delay with a filter,
a soft-clip and a cross-feed inside its feedback loop), `audioshaper` (a
waveshaper whose curve is data, applied above the sample rate),
`audioladder` (a transistor ladder filter — four one-pole stages round a
feedback loop with an odd saturator inside it), `audioconvolve` (apply a
measured or synthesized impulse response, by partitioned FFT), `audioverb`
(a reverberation tank whose line lengths and output taps come from Python),
`audioroute.MidSide` (scale the difference between a stereo pair's channels)
and `audiobiquad` (below) have no ancestor anywhere and are audioif's own.
`apply_cp_patches.sh` adds every one of them to a CircuitPython tree too.

### `audiobiquad` — filters whose tails reach exact zero

`audiofilters.Filter` (over `synthio.Biquad`) and `audiofilters.Phaser` are
ported CircuitPython and their recursions are integer. Both have states that
reproduce themselves: fed silence after a burst, they can hold a constant of
one to a few LSB for ever. `audiobiquad` is the same two filters with
`float` state and a flush of anything below 1e-20, so a tail decays to zero
and stays there — and its all-pass feedback is not clamped to `0.1..0.9`, so
zero is zero and a feedback-free phaser's notches are true nulls.

```python
import audiobiquad, synthio

eq = audiobiquad.Biquad(mode=audiobiquad.PEAKING_EQ, frequency=3200,
                        Q=1.2, gain_db=-4.0, sample_rate=48000)
eq.play(source)

sweep = synthio.LFO(rate=0.4, scale=400.0, offset=900.0)
phase = audiobiquad.AllPass(stages=4, frequency=sweep, feedback=0.0,
                            mix=0.5, sample_rate=48000)
phase.play(eq)
```

| | `Biquad` | `AllPass` |
|---|---|---|
| constructor | `mode`, `frequency`, `Q`, `gain_db`, `mix`, `sample_rate`, `channel_count` | `stages`, `frequency`, `feedback`, `mix`, `sample_rate`, `channel_count` |
| block inputs | `frequency`, `Q`, `gain_db`, `mix` | `frequency`, `feedback`, `mix` |
| fixed at construction | `sample_rate`, `channel_count` | those, plus `stages` (it sizes the state) |
| methods | `play`, `stop`, `clear` | `play`, `stop`, `clear` |
| read-only | `playing`, `coefficients` | `playing`, `stages`, `coefficient` |
| latency | 0 samples | 0 samples |

`mode` is one of `LOW_PASS`, `HIGH_PASS`, `BAND_PASS`, `NOTCH`,
`PEAKING_EQ`, `LOW_SHELF`, `HIGH_SHELF` — numbered exactly as
`synthio.FilterMode` numbers them, so either can be handed to either.
`mix` crossfades: 0 is a wire, 1 is the filtered signal alone; for an
all-pass cascade 0.5 is the equal sum a script phaser makes, and where its
notches are deepest. `AllPass`'s `frequency` really is the frequency at
which one stage's phase passes −90°, so nothing has to pre-warp it. Both
nodes hand out 256 frames at a time, sit in an audiosample chain like any
other effect, and never report themselves finished — a starved chain gets
silence. `Q` is bounded to 0.05..60 and `feedback` to ±0.99: a pole on the
unit circle is a filter that never stops ringing, which is the one thing
this module exists to avoid. See
[docs/upstream-diff.md](docs/upstream-diff.md) for the measurements.

`audiodynamics.Dynamics` carries twenty-one options beyond what the engine
gave it, added for the effects program and every one of them default-off: an
RMS detector, a feedback detector topology and an external key input with Key
Listen, a 4x true-peak reconstruction, a two-pole key band with both corners
settable, a settable expander/gate depth, a four-stage gate envelope with
hold and hysteresis, a relative-threshold gain computer, a program-dependent
attack, and the transient shaper's four detector time constants, a second
envelope pair and a peak-hold on the slow one. What each is for, what it was
measured doing, and what it cost:
[docs/upstream-diff.md](docs/upstream-diff.md).

`audioecho.FeedbackDelay` takes four further options, each off at its
default. `wow_shape` swaps the built-in modulation sine for one period of
your own — `int16` Q15, a power-of-two count from 2 to 4096 — because a
bucket brigade's delay is its line length over its clock, so a triangle on
the clock is a reciprocal on the delay and no sine is that. `delay_slew`
walks the read head to a new `delay_ms` at a constant rate (delay-seconds
per second) instead of jumping to it, which is both an Echoplex's varispeed
and the reason a delay-time knob can be turned mid-take without a click.
`wow_am_depth` puts the same oscillator on the wet gain, dipping only.
`loop_semitones` pitch-shifts the line read *inside* the loop, so every
repeat rises again — a shimmer, which chaining `audiodelays.PitchShift`
after a delay is not. See
[docs/upstream-diff.md](docs/upstream-diff.md) for what each was asked for
and what it measures.

`audioroute.MidSide(source, width=1.0, sample_rate=48000, channel_count=2)`
takes a stereo pair apart into its mono sum and the difference between its
channels, scales the difference, and puts the pair back together. `width=0`
collapses to mono, `1` passes through, `2` doubles the sides; values outside
0..2 clamp to those rails. `play(sample)` sets the source, `set(width=...)`
moves the width mid-stream. There is no state and no latency — and at
`width=1` the output bytes are the input bytes, exactly, for every int16 pair,
so the node costs nothing to leave in a chain that is not using it. A mono
source passes through: there is no difference to scale. It exists for the
drive classes as much as for stereo width: a nonlinearity applied to a stereo
pair intermodulates its channels, so a saturator that wants to keep its image
drives the mid and leaves the side alone.

`audioshaper.Waveshaper(sample_rate=…, curve=…, oversample=4,
channel_count=2, **options)` is the newest of them, and everything but the
first four moves in `set()`. `curve` is int16 Q15, at least two points,
spanning −1..+1 of input: compute it once on a desktop and ship it as data,
never rebuild it on a board, whose float is single-precision where the
desktop's is double. `oversample` is 1, 2, 4 or 8 — the shaping happens there,
between a matched pair of polyphase all-pass half-bands, because a
nonlinearity at the base rate folds the harmonics it makes above Nyquist
straight back onto the signal. `pre_gain` is the drive knob (gain into one
normalised curve, never a curve rebuilt per knob move), `bias` moves the
operating point, `post_gain` follows the curve, and `mix` is a straight 0..1
crossfade. `hysteresis` is **off by default**; above zero it gives the curve a
memory, so a slow signal in and out traces two paths and encloses an area,
with `hysteresis_width` its half-width as a fraction of full scale *at the
input* and `hysteresis_bias` splitting that between the rising and falling
branches. `audioshaper.GROUP_DELAY_SAMPLES` carries the measured group delay
per factor — 0, 2.2, 3.3 and 3.9 base samples — for a component that has to
report its latency. Why each of those is the shape it is, and what the
oversampling measures:
[docs/upstream-diff.md](docs/upstream-diff.md), "`audioshaper`: audioif's own,
and the two things a fixed curve cannot be".

`audioladder` is the newest, and the one whose reason for existing is least
obvious next to a module CircuitPython already has. `audiofilters.Filter`
is a better *resonant low-pass* than this: a cascade of biquads tracks the
analytic response to a fraction of a decibel. It is also linear, so it never
sustains a tone of its own, has no harmonics to speak of, and sounds exactly
the same however hard you hit it — and those three are what a ladder is. The
whole surface:

```python
import audioladder

ladder = audioladder.Ladder(
    sample_rate=48000,      # and channel_count=1 or 2
    cutoff_hz=800.0,        # where the filter turns over
    resonance=3.6,          # 0..4.2; at 4 it sustains a tone at the cutoff
    drive=2.5,              # linear gain into the loop, 1 being unity
    poles=4,                # tap stage 1..4: 6, 12, 18 or 24 dB an octave
    passband_comp=0.0,      # 0..1, how much of the passband to give back
    oversample=2,           # 1 or 2; 2 folds back fewer of its harmonics
    mix=1.0,                # 0 a wire, 1 the filter
)
ladder.play(source)
ladder.set(cutoff_hz=1200.0)   # any option, mid-stream, once a block
ladder.clear()                 # empty the integrators; stops a sustained tone
```

See [docs/upstream-diff.md](docs/upstream-diff.md) for why its feedback loop
is solved rather than delayed, and what that was measured to be worth.

### `audioverb.Tank`

Dattorro's plate reverberator, with the network handed in rather than compiled
in — which is the difference from `audiofreeverb.Freeverb`, whose comb and
all-pass lengths are constants in a CircuitPython-ported kernel.

```python
plate = audioverb.Tank(
    sample_rate=48000, channel_count=2, max_predelay_ms=200,
    decay=0.7, diffusion=0.75, bandwidth_hz=9000, damping_hz=4500,
    mod_rate_hz=1.0, mod_depth_ms=0.27, mix=0.35)
plate.play(source)
audio_out.play(plate)
```

Construction fixes the allocation and the topology: `sample_rate`,
`channel_count` (1 or 2), `max_predelay_ms`, `delays` and `taps`. `delays` is
twelve line lengths in frames — the four input diffusers, then each tank
half's modulated all-pass, delay, all-pass and delay. `taps` is four values
per tap (channel, line index, offset in frames, gain), at most 32. Both
default to Dattorro's published table, scaled from 29761 Hz to `sample_rate`.

`set()` moves the rest, mid-stream and without emptying the lines: `decay`,
`diffusion`, `damping_hz`, `bandwidth_hz`, `low_cut_hz`, `predelay_ms`,
`mod_depth_ms`, `mod_rate_hz`, `drive`, `width`, `tone_db`, `mix`. Every
filter is out of the path at zero, so a bare `Tank()` is that network with
nothing added to it; `mix` follows `audiodelays.Echo`'s 0..2 convention, dry
at unity until 1. `clear()` empties every line and every filter. Latency is
zero dry-to-wet, and the tail reaches *exact* zero rather than sitting at one
LSB — every line write is a magnitude truncation, which is the standard cure
for a recirculating fixed-point network's limit cycles. See
[docs/upstream-diff.md](docs/upstream-diff.md) for the measurement, the cost
and the memory the default table needs.

## Status

**MicroPython:** all module tiers ported and oracle-diffed byte-for-byte
against `bin/circuitpython` on unix; DSP parity re-verified on windows and
wasm; built and measured on two real mcu targets, ESP32-P4
(hardware-confirmed by ear) and RP2040 (build-only). See
[docs/porting-plan.md](docs/porting-plan.md) for the full phased history
and [docs/upstream-diff.md](docs/upstream-diff.md) for every deliberate
deviation from upstream CircuitPython.

**CPython:** the public surface and wheel plumbing are present, and the
committed synthesis, mixer, MIDI, streaming, and effects fixtures match
CircuitPython 10.2.1 PCM byte-for-byte. Import/API smoke success is not used
as a substitute for those oracle comparisons.

`ulab` and `mp3` (the vendored Adafruit_MP3/Helix decoder `audiomp3`
depends on, RPSL/RCSL-licensed — not MIT, carried unmodified per upstream's
own terms) are consumed as cloned sibling dependencies in the parent
workspace, same pattern as `pygraphics`/`displayif`, not vendored into this
repo.

The playback-facing pull protocol (`audiocore.get_buffer`/`reset_buffer`)
is consumed by `pydevices`' `lib/audiodev` package (`AudioOut` in
`sample_out.py`), which pumps any audiosample into any of `audiodev`'s
existing push-PCM transports (sdl2/win/wasm/i2s/emulated) — see that
package's own docs for the playback-side contract this repo's protocol
implementation is built to satisfy.

Acceptance target: todbot's
[`synthtools`](https://github.com/todbot/CircuitPython_SynthTools) running
unmodified, with rendered PCM diffed against `bin/circuitpython`'s own unix
coverage build (which already contains the entire DSP stack — the parity
oracle for this whole port).

## Sound stability

The API is our contract with you: class names, signatures, metadata, and
macro surfaces stay stable and change only deliberately. The *sound* is
not part of that contract. These components sound great, but they are not
all as accurate as they could be, and implementations will keep being
refined as the library matures — so a component may render audibly
differently from one release to the next. If a composition depends on the
exact sound of a release, pin that release rather than tracking the
latest; the code of every release stays available for exactly this
reason.

Beneath the components sits a harder guarantee: the audioif core — the
CircuitPython-compatible `synthio`/`audiocore`/effects-module layer — is
held bit-exact to CircuitPython itself, verified by parity gates, and
that never changes release to release. Where we find CircuitPython and
audioif disagree, we treat it as a bug and report it upstream. The
components are where the sound evolves; the floor they stand on does
not.
