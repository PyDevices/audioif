// _audioif - the audio pump's PLATFORM DRIVER, and the hardware layer of the
// live audio path. The other half of the pump, the portable one, lives in the
// DSP repo: the pull loop, the push ring, the event queue, the tap, the
// status words, the fault register and the lock's contract are all `audiodsp`
// and are built into every port it ships on.
//
// What is here is what that half is not allowed to know:
//
//   the thread -- a FreeRTOS task pinned to the core the interpreter is not
//   on, a _beginthreadex CRT thread on Windows, a pthread on unix;
//
//   the mutex the pump lock is made of, recursive and priority-inheriting
//   where the OS has one;
//
//   the clock, the pacing and the two waits;
//
//   the sink and the source -- a file descriptor on a desktop, an I2S channel
//   and an `Input` that reads a microphone on a board.
//
// It binds by defining audiodsp_port_driver(), which overrides the weak
// default in the engine at link time. The hook table is in THIS translation
// unit, beside MP_REGISTER_MODULE, on purpose: the module table holds an
// undefined reference to `_audioif_module`, so this object is pulled into the
// link whether it arrives loose or inside an archive -- which is the failure
// mode weak binding has, and the one that would leave the default winning
// silently. `audiopump.driver()` is the run-time check that says it worked.
//
// The module is private by convention -- the way usbif ships a C `_usbif`
// under a Python package. `audiodev` is the public face.

//
// Why the interrupt, and not a bigger DMA. The channel pair is allocated with

// recorder that reads every 50 ms from Python would lose most of what that
// holds. The ring decouples the two: TX keeps its 30 ms, RX gets as much
// history as the reader asks for.
//

// refuses a non-owner's unlock with EPERM, which was measured. That FreeRTOS
// refuses it too -- which is why neither ESP32 board ever showed the defect --
// was read out of its source and never run (audiodsp#117).

// This runs it. The interpreter takes the real pump mutex, a second task
// tries to give it, and the BaseType_t that comes back is the answer. It is a
// diagnostic and nothing in the audio path calls it; it is here rather than in
// a test script because the mutex is a static in this file and the question is
// about a task that is not the owner, which Python cannot arrange -- the
// esp32 port's own `_thread` lock is a binary semaphore, which has no owner at
// all and would answer a different question convincingly.
//
// Returns (held_by_other, free_for_all, owner_control): 1 where the give was
// ACCEPTED, 0 where FreeRTOS refused it. The third is a control that MUST
// read 1 -- a task giving back a mutex it took itself -- because 0 is what
// the FreeRTOS source predicts for the first two, so a probe that never ran
// would agree with the expected answer perfectly.
