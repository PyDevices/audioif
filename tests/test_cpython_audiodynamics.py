"""audiodynamics: the traits and the surface the renders cannot check.

`tests/parity/dynamics_probe.py`, `dynamics_options_probe.py` and
`dynamics_extras_probe.py` pin what this module renders across the three
targets. What is left for here is what a render cannot say: the argument forms,
the errors, the source behaviours only a Python-defined audiosample can
produce, and the numeric traits with their bars.

`docs/correctness-standard.md` is what this file implements for
`audiodynamics`: the module is ours - upstream CircuitPython has no
counterpart - so it is held to three-target agreement plus the traits below,
never to a previous version of its own output.

## The traits, with their bars

| ID | Trait | Bar |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | Presents itself as a stereo sample | exact |
| D2 | Keyword order does not change the coefficients | exact |
| D3 | A source that finishes leaves silence behind, not a short block | exact |
| D4 | Gain reduction follows the signal | sign and direction |
| D5 | `stop()` and `play()` are symmetric | exact |
| D6 | A Dynamics can feed another | renders |
| D7 | `gain_smooth_ms` defaults off and is then an identity | exact |
| D8 | Gain smoothing reduces the 50 Hz ripple, monotonically | 6.82 % to 0.41 % at 30 ms |
| D9 | A corrected feedback loop settles at the ratio asked for | 0.01 dB |
| D10 | A corrected loop is still a feedback design | > 1 dB from feed-forward |
| D11 | The corrected slope does not ring | 0.01 dB held, 0.25 dB overshoot |
| D12 | The correction is inert outside COMPRESS and without the detector | exact |
| D13 | `reset()` leaves the node as a freshly built one | exact, 0 LSB |

D8 through D12 arrived with audioif#61 and audioif#62 and were written the same
day; D1 through D6 were here before the traits had names.

**D13 is why the traits exist at all.** It is audioif#56: `reset()` used to keep
the side-chain filter memory, so a reset node was not a fresh one - measured, a
fresh node gated a quiet tone to 0 LSB and the same node after a loud pass and a
reset passed it at 32. The fix is in the shared C, so it moved all three targets
*together* and `verify_dsp` stayed green through it - agreement cannot see a
change that moves every target at once. This trait is what that gate cannot say.
