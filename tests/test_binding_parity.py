"""Our two hand-written bindings per module must expose the same surface.

audioif carries each of its nine own modules twice: `src/<module>/*.c` binds it
for MicroPython, and `src/circuitpython_spike/shared-bindings/<module>/*.c`
binds it for the patched CircuitPython build. They are separate files with
separate locals dicts, and until this file existed nothing held them to each
other.

**Three changes drifted in one day.** On 2026-09-09 `gain_smooth_ms`
(audioif#61), `feedback_gain_corrected` (audioif#62) and `Convolver.latency`
(audioif#44) all went into the MicroPython binding and not the CircuitPython
one, and `deinit()` on thirteen node types (audioif#58/#60/#63) did the same -
so three closed issues were closed on two of three targets. Every one was found
by the *first* three-way `verify_dsp` run rather than by a check, which is
audioif#75. Three in a day is a pattern, and the fourth is cheaper to prevent
than to find.

## What this compares, and what it deliberately does not

It reads the `MP_QSTR_` keys out of every locals dict in both bindings and
requires the sets to match, type for type. That catches a method or property
added to one side and not the other, which is what all four instances were.

It does not compare *behaviour* - two bindings can expose the same names and do
different things. That is `verify_dsp`'s job: every target renders the probes
identically. Nor does it compare argument lists, which are not in the locals
dict. Both are worth having and neither is here; this is the cheap half that
would have caught every instance so far.

`AUDIOSAMPLE_FIELDS` is a macro rather than a key, so its presence is compared
as a name of its own: a binding that dropped it would lose `sample_rate`,
`bits_per_sample` and `channel_count` in one line without any key changing.

    later, or one whose globals table is rewritten, fails this instead of
    shipping unmarked. That was the actual failure mode -- on 2026-09-09 a
    firmware built from a throwaway source tree during a pin move could not be
    attributed to any commit, because nothing in it recorded one.

    Upstream's modules are deliberately NOT checked: adding a dunder to
    `audiocore` or `synthio` would deviate from CircuitPython's surface, and any
    of our nine answers the question (Brad, 2026-09-09).

    **The CircuitPython spike bindings are also excluded, on purpose.** They
    have the same globals-table shape and could carry the marker, but the CP
    build has no `-DAUDIOIF_*` plumbing and does not need any: that binary is a
