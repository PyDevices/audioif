"""`audiobusio.I2SOut` against what CircuitPython documents it to do.

Everything here is a CircuitPython behaviour taken off
`shared-bindings/audiobusio/I2SOut.c` and
`ports/espressif/common-hal/audiobusio/__init__.c`, asked of this firmware's
`audiobusio`. On a desktop the bus is the driver's file sink, paced off the
wall clock, so `playing`, `pause`, `resume` and the end of a sample mean the
same thing here as they do on a board.

    <interpreter> tests/busio_probe.py [scratch-dir] [--fault WHICH]

Every leg prints PASS or FAIL and the last line is the tally; the exit
status is non-zero if anything failed.

Needs a build carrying audioif's usermod AND this repository's, which is
what `.github/workflows/build.yml` makes. On a desktop the bus is this
driver's file sink, paced off the wall clock, so `playing`, `pause`,
`resume` and the end of a sample mean here what they mean on a board --
and the file is the only reason any of it is checkable without ears.

`--fault deaf` makes every byte count read as zero. Nearly every leg here
asks "did the bytes come out", so if the run still passes with the sink
reading empty, the legs are not reading anything and the whole file is
decoration. It is the one plant that cannot be satisfied by accident.
