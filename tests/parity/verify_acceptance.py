"""Require CPython acceptance stdout to match what this port should produce.

This one used to be a straight byte-for-byte match against CircuitPython
10.2.1, and for tiers 0-5 it was. It is not any more: the biquads here carry
three deliberate deviations (the peaking-EQ sign, per-channel filter state,
and the widened coefficients this file's `circuitpython_stdout` predates), and
this script drives a resonant low-pass sweeping down from 300 Hz at 22050 Hz -
the exact case those deviations exist to fix. See docs/upstream-diff.md.

So the fixture now carries both: `stdout` is what this port produces and is
what gets enforced, and `circuitpython_stdout` is the oracle's own answer, kept
so the size and shape of the divergence stays reviewable rather than being
quietly dropped. Pass --capture to re-record `stdout` after an intended change;
`circuitpython_stdout` is only re-recorded by running this against
`bin/circuitpython` by hand.
