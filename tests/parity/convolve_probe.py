"""Deterministic Convolver PCM.

    convolve_probe.py audioconvolve

No oracle, like multiply_probe.py and feedback_delay_probe.py: `audioconvolve`
is audioif's own module, with no ancestor in CircuitPython or in
micropython-vst3's engine. What the golden pins is that every interpreter
renders it identically.

This is the most float-dependent fixture in the suite. Every output sample is
a sum of hundreds of float products routed through two transforms, and the
transforms' twiddle factors come from a series rather than libm precisely so
that three interpreters can agree on them. If any of that were left to the
platform, this is where it would show first -- the whole point of the
arrangement in shared/audioif_trig.h is that it does not.

The synthesized impulse is here as well as the loaded one, because its noise
and its exponentials are generated in C for the same reason: a room that is
not bit-identical between builds is not a room, it is three rooms.
