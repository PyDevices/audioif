"""Deterministic SubOctave PCM.

    suboctave_probe.py audiomath

Like multiply_probe.py and feedback_delay_probe.py this one has no oracle:
`audiomath` is audioif's own module, with no ancestor in CircuitPython or in
micropython-vst3's engine. What the golden pins is that every interpreter
renders it identically -- the arithmetic is entirely inside
shared/audioif_suboctave.c, the same C all three link, so a disagreement
between two of them would itself be the finding.

The fixtures are built with integer arithmetic only, the way multiply_probe.py
builds its modulator: a divider is decided by *where* the signal crosses a
threshold, so a fixture that moved by one LSB because two interpreters rounded
sin() differently would move an edge and change every sample after it.
