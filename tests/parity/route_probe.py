"""Deterministic Splitter PCM, from whichever module provides the node.

    route_probe.py audioroute        the port
    route_probe.py vstaudio_oracle   the original, via the oracle build

Only the positional `Splitter(source, taps)` form is used: the port also
accepts `taps` as a keyword, which the original never did, so that belongs in
the unit tests rather than in a comparison against it.

The source is a double-buffered RawSample, which hands out 300 frames at a
time - enough to walk the ring past its 8192-frame wrap, and short enough that
the 256-frame chunk cap shows up in the block lengths. A source that runs *out*
needs something RawSample cannot do; see route_dry_probe.py.
