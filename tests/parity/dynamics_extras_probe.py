"""Deterministic Dynamics PCM for the two options the original never had.

    dynamics_extras_probe.py audiodynamics

`dynamics_probe.py` is held against `vstaudio_dsp.c` compiled unmodified, so
it may only use forms that original accepts. Lookahead and true-peak detection
are audioif's additions and have no oracle, so they get their own fixture,
captured from the port and holding the three interpreters to each other.

Everything here also proves the halves stay separable: the first case sets
neither option, and its numbers have to match what `dynamics_probe.py` gets
for the same settings.
