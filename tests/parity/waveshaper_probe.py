"""Deterministic Waveshaper PCM.

    waveshaper_probe.py audioshaper

Like multiply_probe.py and feedback_delay_probe.py, this has no oracle:
`audioshaper` is audioif's own module, with no ancestor in CircuitPython or in
micropython-vst3's engine. What the golden pins is that every interpreter
renders it identically.

The curves are built out of integer arithmetic on purpose. A curve computed
with `math.exp` would be a different table under CircuitPython, whose floats
are single-precision, than under CPython and MicroPython, whose are double --
and the probe would then be measuring the interpreters' libm rather than this
node. Everything here is `//` on ints, so the same table reaches all three.

The half-band filters are recursive and run in `float` at up to eight times
the sample rate, so this is a sensitive fixture in the same way the feedback
delay's is: a one-ulp disagreement between two builds is fed back through the
all-pass sections rather than staying one ulp.

Two of the lines are verdicts rather than PCM. `hysteresis=0` has to render
the same bytes as a node that was never given the option at all -- that is
what makes it an additive option rather than a change -- and `hysteresis=0.7`
has to render different bytes, or the option is not wired to anything. Both
are printed, so the golden pins the answers and not just the samples.
