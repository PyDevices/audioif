"""A stand-in for the `vstaudio` host module, so the original instrument
scripts can be imported and played outside a VST3 sidecar.

Only what those scripts touch is here: the sample rate they build their tables
from, the two registration calls they end with, the transport reading the
tempo-synced ones poll, and the event constants. It exists so the parity probes
can capture what the scripts sounded like before they were ported.
