"""Every node in the palette releases, and refuses to be used afterwards.

Runs unchanged on the CPython target, on desktop MicroPython and on
`circuitpython-effects`, because the thing it asserts is the same on all
three: a node has `deinit()`, calling it marks the node released, and every
way back into the audio path then raises instead of handing out stale audio
or reading freed memory.

It does not compare exception *types*, on purpose. The native builds raise
CircuitPython's `ValueError` and the CPython target raises `RuntimeError`
(audioif#73); this probe is not the place to settle that, so it records only
that the guard fired.

**The fault this exists to catch.** Twelve of the twenty-five node types --
every one audioif wrote rather than ported from CircuitPython -- had no
`deinit()` at all, so no class built on them could release one and Tier 1's
"deinit() releases every node the class built" was unmeasurable on a board
(audioif#58, #60, #63). One of them, `audiomixer.Mixer`, had `deinit()` and
no guard on the C protocol entry point, and pulling a released one dumped
core (audioif#59).

Run `--fault` to check the probe can fail: it skips the `deinit()` call, so
every node reads as unreleased and the run must exit nonzero. A probe whose
failing mode was never run is not a gate.
