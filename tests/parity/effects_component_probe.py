    """FNV-1a over the bytes.

    `sum(data)` is a sum over UNSIGNED BYTES, so it is invariant under any
    permutation of a block AND under any set of byte deltas that cancel - at
    any magnitude, with a sample's high and low byte weighted equally. A
    +256-LSB sample error (about -42 dBFS, plainly audible) paid for by a
    single -1-LSB error was invisible here. 138 of this probe's 139 lines
    carried only that statistic, so the gate checked 16 of 32,002 samples at
    PCM level - 0.05%. See issue #20 and audioif#15.

    This is order- and magnitude-sensitive. audiocomponents' instrument probes
    (`tests/parity/instruments_probe_new.py` there) use the same function for
    the same reason. The sum is printed alongside so the older
    per-architecture records stay comparable.
