"""The one gate that can see a synthio voice-ceiling change (audioif#27).

WHAT THIS COVERS THAT THE OTHER FOUR CANNOT
===========================================

`verify_acceptance`, `verify_effects`, `verify_streaming` and
`verify_biquad` all render material that stays inside the mix-down
limiter's linear region, so every one of them is byte-identical at any
value of the voice ceiling. A ceiling change ships green through all
four. `mixdown_knee_probe.py`'s material crosses the +/-28000 knee, where
`SYNTHIO_MIX_DOWN_SCALE` -- a function of the ceiling -- multiplies every
sample, so its output moves when the ceiling moves.

Scope, stated narrowly on purpose: the CPython target reads exactly ONE
of the ceiling's five sites, `src/cpython/synthio.py`'s
`Synthesizer.max_polyphony`, which it hands to `_audioif.mixdown_i32` as
the limiter divisor. That is the only site this gate observes. The
header, `micropython.mk` and `micropython.cmake` copies are read by no CI
gate at all, so `tests/test_voice_ceiling_consistency.py` is still the
guard against a half-applied change. What this gate adds is the other
failure: a ceiling moved CONSISTENTLY across all five sites, which that
test passes by construction and which silently changes the audio.

WHAT IS ENFORCED AGAINST WHAT -- read this before trusting the word
"oracle" anywhere near this file
================================================================

Check (a), the gate proper: the probe's full stdout must equal
`stdout` in the golden. `stdout` is THIS PORT's output, not the
CircuitPython oracle's, and above the knee the two cannot agree. The
port ships CIRCUITPY_SYNTHIO_MAX_CHANNELS=64 and the pinned oracle is
built at 14; SYNTHIO_MIX_DOWN_SCALE is 129 at 64 and 623 at 14, and it
scales every sample past the knee. So no material can be both above the
knee and oracle-identical. The above-knee half of this gate is therefore
NOT oracle-enforced, and nothing here should be described as if it were.
That divergence is the ceiling and nothing else; it is not yet written
down in docs/upstream-diff.md (open with Brad).

Check (b), the anti-launder tripwire, and the only check here that
survives a re-capture: the ceiling this interpreter actually reports
(`synthio.Synthesizer.max_polyphony`) must equal `port_max_polyphony` in
the golden. Re-capture `stdout` under a changed ceiling and check (a)
goes green again -- but (b) goes red, because the golden still declares
the old number. Getting green then requires editing `port_max_polyphony`
too, which puts the ceiling change on one visible, reviewable line of the
diff instead of hiding it inside ten changed digests. This was measured,
not assumed: with `src/cpython/synthio.py`'s ceiling set to 24 and
`stdout` re-captured, (a) passed and (b) failed.

Check (c), narrow and worth having anyway: the below_knee lines of the
actual output must equal the below_knee lines of `circuitpython_stdout`,
the oracle's own captured answer. Below the knee the port and the oracle
ARE byte-identical (measured on all three runtimes, 2026-09-06), so while
(a) passes this cannot fail -- it is logically implied by (a). It does
NOT catch a laundered ceiling change, because a ceiling change leaves the
below-knee lines untouched; that is check (b)'s job and it is why (b)
exists. What (c) catches is a re-capture of `stdout` after some OTHER
change that moved below-knee output -- an oscillator or envelope edit --
where the oracle field was left behind.

REPRODUCING THE PLANTED FAULT (there is a trap here)
====================================================

Edit `max_polyphony = 64` to some other two-digit number in
`src/cpython/synthio.py` and run this gate; it must exit non-zero. Then
`git checkout -- src/cpython/synthio.py` and run it again; it must be
green. **Delete `src/cpython/__pycache__` between those steps.** `= 64`
and `= 24` are the same byte length, and CPython validates a cached .pyc
on (source mtime, source size) -- so a plant and a revert inside the same
second leave a stale .pyc that passes validation, and the gate then
reports the planted fault's numbers against a source that says 64. That
looked exactly like a broken revert here on 2026-09-06 and was not one.
Check `python -c "import synthio; print(synthio.Synthesizer.max_polyphony)"`
after each step rather than trusting the file.

CAPTURING
=========

`--capture` re-records `stdout` and `sha256` from this interpreter.
`--capture-reference NAME BINARY` runs the probe under BINARY and records
`NAME_stdout` plus that binary's sha256. As with `verify_biquad.py` and
`verify_acceptance.py`: capturing after the fact, on a change whose gates
went red, is not the fix. The delta gets reported.
