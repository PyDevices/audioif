"""Deterministic FeedbackDelay PCM for the four options the node grew later.

    feedback_delay_options_probe.py audioecho

`feedback_delay_probe.py` covers the node as it was: a sine on the delay, a
`delay_ms` that lands in one jump, no level modulation and a line read at
unity. `wow_shape`, `delay_slew`, `wow_am_depth` and `loop_semitones` are
additions, and they get their own fixture rather than joining that one -- the
same split `dynamics_extras_probe.py` makes, and for the same reason. That
file's hash is one hash over its whole output, so a case appended to it would
move the number that says the addition changed nothing.

Neither has an oracle: `audioecho` is audioif's own, with no ancestor in
CircuitPython or in micropython-vst3's engine. What the golden pins is that
every interpreter renders these identically, which matters more here than
almost anywhere else in the suite -- the loop is recursive and runs in
`float`, so a one-ulp disagreement is fed back in and amplified for as long
as the feedback holds.

Two cases here are the separability check rather than coverage. `off` sets
every new option to its default explicitly and has to render exactly what
`feedback_delay_probe.py`'s `plain` renders; `slew-still` turns the slew on
with nothing to glide to, and has to render that same PCM again -- a read
head primed at zero instead of on the delay it was told to hold would sweep
the whole line here and be obvious.
