"""Deterministic Ladder PCM.

    ladder_probe.py audioladder

Like multiply_probe.py and feedback_delay_probe.py, this has no oracle:
`audioladder` is audioif's own module, with no ancestor in CircuitPython or
in micropython-vst3's engine. What the golden pins is that every interpreter
renders it identically.

It belongs in the same sensitive class as feedback_delay_probe.py, and for a
sharper reason. That loop is recursive and runs in `float`; this one is
recursive, runs in `float`, and is *solved* rather than stepped -- a fixed
four passes of a contraction seeded by extrapolating the last two samples.
A one-ulp disagreement between two builds therefore has two ways to grow:
round the feedback loop, as it does in the delay, and through the solver's
seed. Several of the fixtures below sit at or past the feedback where the
loop sustains a tone of its own, which is the state in which nothing damps a
difference at all.
