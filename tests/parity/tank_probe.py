"""Deterministic Tank PCM.

    tank_probe.py audioverb

Like multiply_probe.py and feedback_delay_probe.py, this has no oracle:
`audioverb` is audioif's own module, with no ancestor in CircuitPython or in
micropython-vst3's engine. What the golden pins is that every interpreter
renders it identically.

The tank is the most recursive thing in the suite. Six all-passes and four
delays feed each other in `float`, the two halves cross, and the whole network
runs for as long as the decay holds -- so a one-ulp disagreement between two
builds is not a one-ulp disagreement in the output, it is amplified for
thousands of frames. If three builds are going to fall out of step about
floating point, this is where it shows first.

The last fixture is not a checksum. `tail` prints the block at which the wet
output reaches *exact* zero, which is the whole reason every line write goes
through a magnitude-truncating quantiser rather than a rounding one: rounding
gives a network that sits at one LSB forever. A build whose quantiser started
rounding would still hash its other fixtures plausibly and would print `none`
here.
