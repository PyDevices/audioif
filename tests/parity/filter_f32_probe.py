"""Deterministic audiobiquad PCM, and the two invariants the module exists for.

    filter_f32_probe.py audiobiquad

Like multiply_probe.py and feedback_delay_probe.py, this has no oracle:
`audiobiquad` is audioif's own module, with no ancestor in CircuitPython or in
micropython-vst3's engine. What the golden pins is that every interpreter
renders it identically, and that nothing moves it by accident later.

It is deliberately **not** byte-gated against `audiofilters.Filter` or
`audiofilters.Phaser`. Those are the ported integer kernels this module was
added because of; agreeing with them bit for bit would mean it had failed.
What is checked against them is a level agreement, in
`tests/test_cpython_audiobiquad.py`, which needs arithmetic no probe should
be doing.

Two of the sections are invariants rather than PCM, because they are the
whole ask:

- **tail** prints the first output block that is all zero after the source
  goes silent. The ported kernels cannot answer this: `audioif_biquad.c`'s
  Q12 recursion has fixed points it can park on (measured, audioif#23:
  100 Hz at +/-1 LSB, 40 Hz at +/-4 LSB, held for 3000 blocks of silence),
  and `audioif_phaser.c`'s int16 all-pass memory has its own. A negative
  number here means the tail never reached zero, and that is a failure.
- **null** prints the settled peak of a tone at a frequency the four-stage
  cascade inverts. At `feedback=0.0` it is a true cancellation; the ported
  node clamps feedback to 0.1 (`audiofilters/Phaser.c:211`) and cannot get
  there.

Everything a probe prints has to be integer-exact on three interpreters, so
the test tone is a 64-entry sine table with integer entries, stepped by whole
samples -- never `math.sin()`, which is three functions that nearly agree.
Nothing here drives a parameter with a `synthio` block for the same reason:
the block layer is C on two targets and Python on the third, and a golden
that hashed it would be measuring that seam rather than this module's.
