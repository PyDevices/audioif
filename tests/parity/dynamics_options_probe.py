"""Deterministic Dynamics PCM for the options the original never had.

    dynamics_options_probe.py audiodynamics

Like `feedback_delay_probe.py` and `dynamics_extras_probe.py`, this has no
oracle. `dynamics_probe.py` is held against micropython-vst3's
`vstaudio_dsp.c` compiled unmodified, so it may only use forms that original
accepts; everything the effects program added to `audiodynamics` -- the RMS
detector, the feedback and external-key detector topologies, the 4x true-peak
reconstruction, the key band's second pole and low corner, Key Listen, the
settable expander/gate depth, the gate's four-stage envelope, the
relative-threshold gain computer, the program-dependent attack, and the
transient shaper's now-settable time constants, second envelope pair and slow
peak-hold -- has no ancestor to be held to. What the golden pins is that every
interpreter renders it identically.

The first case, `off`, sets none of them, and its numbers are
`dynamics_probe.py`'s `compress` case line for line: same source, same
settings, same five blocks. That is the check that says the twenty-one
additions are additive rather than a rewrite.
