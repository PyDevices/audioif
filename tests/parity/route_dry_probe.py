"""What a Splitter does once its source runs out.

    route_dry_probe.py audioroute        the port
    route_dry_probe.py vstaudio_oracle   the original, via the oracle build

Separate from route_probe.py because it needs a source that finishes, and the
only one available to all of these interpreters is `audiospeed.SpeedChanger`
over a short RawSample - a RawSample on its own hands out its whole buffer
forever. CircuitPython 10.2.1 ships audiospeed but its unix `coverage` variant
does not compile it, so this probe is not part of that interpreter's gate; the
same shared C runs there either way, and enabling a module the oracle leaves
out to suit a test would be the wrong trade.
