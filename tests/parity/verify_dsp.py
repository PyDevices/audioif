"""Every target must render these nodes identically. That is the whole gate.

    verify_dsp.py --micropython PATH [--circuitpython PATH]

`docs/correctness-standard.md` is what this implements. There is no stored
digest and no oracle: the probes are run on every interpreter given, and the
gate is that their output is byte-identical. A disagreement is the finding.

**Two interpreters are the minimum, and fewer is refused rather than passed.**
A single-interpreter run has nothing to compare and cannot fail, which is worse
than no gate at all because it reports green. This script used to accept
`--interpreters cpython` and used to print `skipping micropython (not built
at ...)` and carry on; both are gone.

## Why agreement is the right check for these nodes

All three targets compile the same C - `shared/audioif_dynamics.c`,
`audioif_splitter.c`, `audioif_midside.c`, `audioif_multiply.c`,
`audioif_suboctave.c`, `audioif_feedback_delay.c`, `audioif_shaper.c`,
`audioif_ladder.c`, `audioif_convolve.c`, `audioif_tank.c`,
`audioif_flanger.c`, `audioif_granular_pitch_shift.c`, with `audioif_fft.c` and
`audioif_trig.c` under the convolver. The CPython extension links it, the
MicroPython usermod compiles it, and the patched CircuitPython build compiles it
again. So a difference between two of them is never a difference of intent: it
is a width, an undefined shift, a compiler's choice or an architecture. That is
exactly the class of defect a stored digest cannot see, and it is not
hypothetical - on 2026-09-09 the MicroPython flanger overflowed `int32_t` in its
wet interpolation on full-scale material and every stored fixture matched to the
byte throughout.

**What agreement cannot see, said plainly:** a change to the shared C moves all
three together and stays green. This gate sees divergence between targets, not
drift over time. Drift is the traits' job -
`tests/test_cpython_<module>.py`, one file per module, each opening with its
trait table and bars.

## Five of these are unusually sensitive, which is most of the reason to run
## them everywhere

The delay's loop is recursive, so a one-ulp disagreement between two builds
would not stay one ulp; the waveshaper's half-bands are all-pass recursions
running at up to eight times the sample rate; the ladder's loop is recursive AND
solved, so a difference has the solver's seed to grow through as well, and
several of its fixtures sit where the loop sustains a tone of its own and
nothing damps a difference at all; every convolver output sample is a sum of
hundreds of float products through two transforms; and the tank is ten
recirculating lines feeding each other in float, which is the delay's problem
again with the loop closed twice over.

## Why some nodes have two probes rather than one appended case

One comparison covers a probe's whole output, so a case appended to
`feedback_delay_probe.py` would move the very numbers that say `wow_shape`,
`delay_slew`, `wow_am_depth` and `loop_semitones` changed nothing. Those live in
`feedback_delay_options_probe.py`, whose first two cases render exactly what
that file's `plain` renders. `dynamics_extras_probe.py` and
`dynamics_options_probe.py` carry the same additivity check: the first case of
each sets none of the options it exists to cover, and its numbers are a case of
`dynamics_probe.py` line for line.

`filter_f32_probe.py` also prints invariants rather than only PCM - the block at
which a tail reaches exact zero, and the depth of a null at zero feedback -
because those two are why `audiobiquad` was added, and PCM alone would not say
whether either still held.
