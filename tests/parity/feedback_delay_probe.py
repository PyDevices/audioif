"""Deterministic FeedbackDelay PCM.

    feedback_delay_probe.py audioecho

Like multiply_probe.py, this has no oracle: `audioecho` is audioif's own
module, with no ancestor in CircuitPython or in micropython-vst3's engine.
What the golden pins is that every interpreter renders it identically.

That matters more here than anywhere else in the suite. The loop is
recursive and runs in `float`, so a difference of one ulp anywhere in it
does not stay one ulp -- it is fed back in and amplified for as long as the
feedback holds. If the three builds are going to disagree about floating
point at all, this is where it will show.
