"""Deterministic MidSide PCM.

    midside_probe.py audioroute

Like multiply_probe.py, this has no oracle. `audioroute.Splitter` came from
micropython-vst3's engine, but `MidSide` did not: it is audioif's own, with no
ancestor in CircuitPython or in that engine either. What the golden pins is
that every interpreter renders it identically -- the arithmetic is entirely
inside shared/audioif_midside.c, the same C all three link, so a disagreement
between two of them would itself be the finding.

Two things a checksum cannot say are asserted here as well, because they are
the node's contract rather than its output:

- at ``width=1`` the output bytes are the input bytes, for every int16 pair.
  A checksum would go on matching a golden captured from a node that had
  quietly started costing the chain an LSB; only the comparison catches it.
- the mono sum survives, to within one LSB per frame, at every width. That is
  what says the halving rounds both halves the same way rather than tilting
  the balance as the width moves.

Both print their result, so the golden covers them too.
