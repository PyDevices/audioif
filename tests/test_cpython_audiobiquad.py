"""audiobiquad: the claims the parity golden cannot make on its own.

`tests/parity/filter_f32_probe.py` pins what this module renders, and prints
the two invariants as integers so a hash covers them. What it deliberately
does not do is compare the module with the ported kernels it was added
because of -- that needs decibels, and a probe whose output has to be
integer-exact on three interpreters should not be computing logarithms.

So the comparisons live here:

- the float biquad agrees with `audiofilters.Filter` mid-band, which is what
  says it is the same filter and not merely a filter;
- one all-pass stage's phase really does pass -90 degrees at `frequency`,
  where the ported phaser's lands high enough that its class has to pre-warp;
- `feedback=0.0` nulls, and the ported node's 0.1..0.9 clamp cannot get near
  it however its frequency is trimmed;
- and the frozen `synthio.Biquad` kernel has fixed points it parks on, which
  is the measurement audioif#23 is about, reproduced here at the kernel so
  the contrast is a fact in the tree rather than a link.

## The traits, with their bars

`docs/correctness-standard.md` is what this file implements for `audiobiquad`:
the module is ours, upstream CircuitPython has no counterpart, so it is held to
three-target agreement (`tests/parity/filter_f32_probe.py`, run by `verify_dsp`)
plus the numeric traits below. Each has an ID so an issue or an evidence pack
can cite one, and each names its bar so nobody has to read the assertion to
learn what is being promised.

| ID | Trait | Bar |
|---|---|---|
| B1 | The float kernel is the same filter as `audiofilters.Filter` mid-band | 1.5 dB across the band |
| B2 | A shelf reaches the gain it was asked for | 0.5 dB |
| B3 | `mix=0` is a bit-exact wire | exact |
| B4 | Every mode's tail reaches exact zero and stays there | exact, inside 600 blocks |
| B5 | An all-pass tail reaches exact zero at every feedback | exact |
| B6 | One all-pass stage passes −90° at `frequency` | 12° |
| B7 | `feedback=0.0` nulls, which the ported clamp cannot reach | 0 against ≥ 1 LSB |
| B8 | Silence in gives exactly zero out, every mode | exact |
| B9 | Full-scale DC passes a low-pass at unity | exact, 0 LSB |
| B10 | `clear()` leaves the node as a freshly built one, every mode | exact |
| B11 | A band-pass peaks at 0 dB at its own centre | 0.05 dB at and above 100 Hz; 0.15 dB at the 20-63 Hz corner |
| B12 | Presents as a sample; a starved node yields silence, not a short block | exact |

**B11's recorded departure is CLOSED (audioif#64, 2026-09-09).** It had two
causes and only one of them was the filter. The measurement ended before the
resonator had rung up: the old window reached 2.09 ring-up time constants at
20 Hz / Q 32 and read −1.1474 dB, where `20*log10(1 - exp(-2.09))` is
−1.147 dB — the whole of it. `_peak_db` now derives its window from
`Q*rate/(pi*f0)` and `test_the_short_window_reads_the_ring_up_not_the_filter`
keeps it honest. The filter's own share was real but far smaller: direct form I
differences two nearly-equal large numbers when the poles sit near the unit
circle, and over the 8×7 f0/Q grid at three probe levels it had 7 of 56 cells
outside 0.05 dB, worst +0.2034 dB. Transposed direct form II has 1 of 56, worst
−0.0785 dB, and costs nothing at run time. The one cell left is 31.5 Hz / Q 32
at −0.0899 dB, and it is level-independent, so it is the `float` coefficients
placing the pole pair slightly beside `f0` rather than round-off.

**Where a trait has a control that fails it**, the control is named in the test
rather than left implied: a trait no implementation can fail is not a
measurement. B9's control is `audiofilters.Filter`, which settles a full-scale
DC step at 28520 rather than 32767 - not a defect, but upstream's two-voice
mix-down knee, `(32767 - 28000) * 7151 >> 16 + 28000`, which this module does
not apply. B4's control is the frozen `synthio.Biquad` kernel, whose fixed
points are the subject of audioif#23 and are reproduced here.
