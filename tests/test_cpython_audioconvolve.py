"""audioconvolve: the traits and the surface the renders cannot check.

`tests/parity/convolve_probe.py` pins what this module renders across the three
targets. What is left for here is what a render cannot say, and the numeric
traits with their bars.

`docs/correctness-standard.md` is what this file implements for
`audioconvolve`: the module is ours - upstream CircuitPython has no counterpart
- so it is held to three-target agreement plus the traits below, never to a
previous version of its own output.

## The traits, with their bars

| ID | Trait | Bar |
|---|---|---|
| C1 | Unloaded, it is a bit-exact passthrough, at the rails included | exact, 0 LSB |
| C2 | Loaded at `mix=0` it is an exact wire, latency-compensated | exact, 0 LSB |
| C3 | A unit-impulse IR reproduces the input, delayed by `latency` | 1 LSB |
| C4 | Nothing but silence comes out before `latency` frames have passed | exact |
| C5 | Silence in is exactly zero out | exact |
| C6 | `clear()` leaves the node as a freshly built one | exact |
| C7 | `latency` reports the loaded state, not a constant | exact |
| C8 | A starved node yields a full block of silence, not a short block | exact |

**C1 and C2 are this module's form of the identity trait** that
`docs/correctness-standard.md` asks of every own node: an exact answer *through*
the DSP rather than around it, evaluated at full scale, because that is where an
arithmetic overflow shows and a range check does not.

C2 is worth reading twice, because the obvious expectation is wrong: `mix=0` on
a loaded convolver is **not** an instant wire. The dry path is delayed by the
same `latency` as the wet one, so a mix does not smear the two against each
other. Measured, it is exact once the latency has passed - 0 LSB over 4608
samples - and silence before it.

C3's bar is 1 LSB rather than exact for an arithmetic reason, not a sloppy one:
the tallest impulse int16 can hold is 32767, so a "unit" impulse has gain
32767/32768 and the reproduction is short by that much.

C7 is audioif#44's class-side clause. It returned `AUDIOIF_CONVOLVE_FRAMES`
unconditionally until 2026-09-09, so an unloaded convolver - which is a
passthrough and adds no latency at all - reported a whole partition of it.
