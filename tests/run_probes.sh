# Unlike the workflow beside it, which builds an interpreter from scratch and
# therefore knows exactly what is in it, this runs whatever binary you point
# it at -- and a `bin/` binary is built by hand and goes stale silently.
# On 2026-09-03 that cost a week of green gates in this workspace: a binary
# built thirteen minutes before a C change certified that change for a week.
# So the first thing here is a refusal, not a probe: the binary's
# provenance stamp has to name THIS repository's HEAD, or nothing runs.
#
# A stale binary is not a smaller version of a current one. It is a different
# driver that happens to answer to the same name, and every digest it prints
# is about code you are not looking at.
#
# AUDIOIF_SKIP_PROVENANCE=1 skips the check. It is for a checkout with no
# the workspace beside it, not for a run that would rather not know.
