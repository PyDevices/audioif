"""The three option tables for `audiodynamics` must agree, name for number.

`Dynamics` takes its settings by keyword, and each keyword has to reach the
same slot in `audioif_dynamics_configure()` on all three targets. Three tables
say which slot:

    src/shared/audioif_dynamics.h   the C enum -- the authority
    src/audiodynamics/Dynamics.c    MicroPython, name -> enum constant
    src/cpython/audiodynamics.py    the CPython twin, name -> a LITERAL INTEGER

Only the middle one is safe. It names the enum constants, so a typo is a
compile error and a reordered enum moves with it. The CPython twin writes the
numbers out by hand -- `"feedback_detector": 17` -- and its own comment says
why that is load-bearing: *"these numbers are the C enum's, and the C enum only
ever grows."* Nothing enforced it. An option appended to the enum in the wrong
place, or a number typed one out, would send `sidechain_lp_hz` to
`feedback_detector`'s slot on the CPython target only, and the parity gates
would report it as a DSP divergence rather than as a table error.

This is the same shape as `test_voice_ceiling_consistency.py`: several
independent copies of one fact, no mechanism making them agree, so a check
over them is the mechanism.
