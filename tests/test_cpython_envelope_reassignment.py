"""Reassigning ``note.envelope`` takes effect on the next render block.

The MicroPython and CircuitPython builds fetch a note's envelope on every
block (``synthio_synth_get_note_envelope``, called from the render loop), so
assigning ``note.envelope`` is live. This target used to cache the envelope
definition inside the state object at press time, so a re-pressed note kept
stepping the PREVIOUS envelope.

That divergence was invisible to a one-shot render and only appeared when one
circuit was shared by two voices with different decays - the pattern several
audioinstruments kits use for closed/open hats and for clap/maracas. Measured
on a shared claves+cowbell circuit before the fix: claves inherited the
cowbell's 203 ms tail (53 ms alone) and cowbell was cut to the claves' 55 ms.
Both runtimes and the built oracle were correct; only this target was wrong.

Verified against the parent workspace's built ``circuitpython`` and
``micropython``: all three now agree to the sample.
