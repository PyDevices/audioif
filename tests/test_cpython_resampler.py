"""`audiospeed.Resampler`: the ratio is bound by whoever plays it.

CircuitPython 10.3.0 added the node. The thing worth testing is not the
resampling arithmetic - `tests/parity/resampler_probe.py` pins that, on both
interpreters, against a golden - but the **binding**, because it is the one
piece of machinery in the palette that reaches back up the graph:
`audiosample_must_match` exempts a Resampler from the sample-rate check that
refuses every other node, and then hands it the destination's rate. One call
site, and every node's `play()` goes through it.

Both halves matter and each is a fault for the other. Without the exemption a
Resampler could never be played at all, which is the whole point of one.
Without the exemption being **narrow**, every genuine rate mismatch in the
palette would be silently accepted - so the first test here is that a plain
sample at the wrong rate is still refused.
