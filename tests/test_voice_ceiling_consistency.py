"""The voice ceiling lives in five places. This asserts they agree.

Why this test exists, and why it is not paranoia:

The four older parity gates in this repository are **byte-identical at N=14,
36 and 56** -- measured, not assumed. `verify_acceptance`, `verify_effects`,
`verify_streaming`, `verify_biquad` and the rest of this suite render material
that never fills 14 channels and never crosses the mix-down knee at +/-28000,
so none of them can observe a change to CIRCUITPY_SYNTHIO_MAX_CHANNELS at all.

Since 2026-09-06 a fifth gate does cross the knee --
`tests/parity/verify_mixdown_knee.py`, audioif#27 -- but it sees exactly ONE
of the five sites. The CPython target reads only `src/cpython/synthio.py`'s
`max_polyphony`, which it hands to `_audioif.mixdown_i32` as the limiter
divisor; the header, `micropython.mk` and `micropython.cmake` copies are read
by no CI gate whatever.

So a ceiling change applied to three of the five sites still ships GREEN, and
nothing else in CI would say a word. This test remains the only thing standing
between a HALF-APPLIED ceiling and a release. What the knee gate adds is the
other failure -- a ceiling moved consistently across all five sites, which
this test passes by construction and which silently changes the audio.

The five sites are genuinely independent -- three build paths plus two
constants inside the CPython target, which does not read the header
(setup.py builds _audioif from src/cpython/ and src/shared/ only, never from
src/synthio/). There is no mechanism making them agree; only this check.

DELIBERATELY NOT INCLUDED: `_audioif.c`'s `0x0fffffff / (32768 * 2 - 28000)`
is SYNTHIO_MIX_DOWN_SCALE(2) faithfully mirroring upstream CircuitPython's
own two-channel default in a code path that is not ours to re-tune. It is a
literal 2 that must stay 2. If you are here because you changed the ceiling
and this test still passed, check that you did not "fix" that line too.

#: The pinned CircuitPython oracle binary, and its hash.
#:
#: The oracle is built at the SAME ceiling this port ships (64) and at the same
#: CircuitPython version the port tracks (10.3.0). It is rebuilt deliberately
#: whenever either moves, and re-pinned in that change -- the old rule
#: ("built at 14 and must never be rebuilt") is retired: an oracle at a
#: different configuration cannot answer the only question worth asking, which
#: is whether we render CircuitPython's bytes in the same situation. See
#: docs/correctness-standard.md. The hole this closes is unchanged: a
#: CFLAGS_EXTRA rebuild of the oracle needs no edit to any tracked file,
#: leaves `git -C cmods/circuitpython status` clean, and overwrites the
#: gitignored binary in place. Every existing check would pass on a silently
#: different oracle. Comparing the bytes is the only thing that notices.
#:
#: Re-pinned again 2026-09-09, later the same day, for audioif#64: the
#: `audiobiquad` float biquad moved to transposed direct form II, and
#: `audiobiquad` is one of the nine modules `apply_cp_patches.sh` adds to the CP
#: tree -- so a change to our own shared kernel relinks this binary even though
#: CircuitPython's own sources are untouched. Verified: CircuitPython's own
#: modules are byte-identical across the rebuild (`synthtools_acceptance` and
#: `mixdown_knee`'s stored `circuitpython_stdout` both reproduce exactly), and
#: `verify_dsp` agrees on all three interpreters again. Previous:
#: 94500bc0382f1cc2.
#:
#: Re-pinned 2026-09-09 for the deliberate rebuild to CircuitPython 10.3.0 at
#: CIRCUITPY_SYNTHIO_MAX_CHANNELS=64, replacing the 10.2.1-at-14 build
#: b3063621c72a085b (kept at cmods/bin/circuitpython-oracle-10.2.1). That
#: rebuild is what found the two synthio/audiomixer behaviour changes 10.3.0
#: made and this port had not taken: the panning polarity flip and the
#: zero-crossing loudness gate.
#:
#: It noticed once (#33). The hash was first recorded at dda8a77 on
#: 2026-09-03 20:46; the binary was relinked at 23:05 the same evening by the
#: jpegio Phase 2 landing (an aggregator reinstall adding lvgl, pygraphics and
#: usdl2 -- nothing audio), and the pin went red for every session after.
#: The relinked binary still answers 14 voices and still reproduces both
#: committed reference digests, so it is re-pinned to the bytes it has, with
#: this note as the provenance the relink never recorded. A future mismatch
#: means what it meant then: find what rebuilt it, ask it the ceiling, and
#: re-pin with the reason written down.
