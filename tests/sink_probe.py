"""The driver's file sink hands over exactly what the engine pulled.

    <interpreter> tests/sink_probe.py [scratch-dir] [--fault WHICH]

The engine (audioif) computes an FNV-1a 64 digest of every byte it pulls
and leaves it in its status block. The sink is **this** repository: the one
place a block stops being the engine's and becomes a platform's -- a file
here, an I2S channel on a board. So the check is the engine's own digest
against a digest of the file, and the only thing between them is the code
in this repo.

It matters because a sink is where a byte count quietly stops matching. A
short write, a buffer handed over twice, a block dropped when the writer is
behind: none of those raise, and all of them are audible.

Faults: ``flip`` changes one byte of the file before it is hashed;
``truncate`` cuts the last block off. Each must make this exit non-zero.
