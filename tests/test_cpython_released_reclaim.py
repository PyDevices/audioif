"""A released note's channel comes back before its tail has finished.

The oracle does not simply refuse a press at capacity. When no channel is
free, ``find_channel_with_note`` is called with ``SYNTHIO_SILENCE``
(``src/synthio/__init__.c:361``) and scans the channels where the note is
*not playing* — released ones, still sounding out their tails — taking the
quietest. Only when every channel is genuinely held does it return -1 and
refuse.

This target used to hold a released note's slot for its entire release tail,
because ``_render`` drops a note only once its level reaches 0. The effect was
not subtle: with all fourteen notes released a fresh press was still refused,
and the slot returned 758 render blocks later. Driving ``rhodes`` through the
parity sequence, **117 of its 122 refusals happened with no key held at all** —
the engine clogged by its own decaying voices rather than full.

Verified against the parent workspace's built ``circuitpython`` and
``micropython``: all three now report the same pair of outcomes.
