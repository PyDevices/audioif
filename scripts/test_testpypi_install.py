"""Smoke a fresh pydevices-audioif install from TestPyPI.

    scripts/test_testpypi_install.py [VERSION] [--skip-render]

`docs/building-wheels.md` names this as a post-release step to run on fresh
Linux and Windows hosts. Two things used to stop it being one (audioif#72):
the version was frozen into the source as `0.0.1`, so it smoked a 2026-08-25
build whichever release it was run for, and its embedded snippet used
`array(...)` with no import, so it raised `NameError` before it could assert
anything -- after two lines of real work had already printed, which reads
like a packaging failure rather than a typo in the checker.

VERSION now defaults to this checkout's `VERSION` file, so the script follows
the release it is run beside. Pass one explicitly to smoke any other.

Two environments are built, each from scratch, because they answer different
questions: the bare install is what someone who wants the audio nodes gets,
and the `[render]` install is the only check anywhere that the extra's name is
still spelled the way `pyproject.toml` declares it (audioif#35). `--skip-render`
drops the second if numpy's download is not welcome.

`--extra-index-url` is not optional: TestPyPI alone cannot resolve numpy, and
a run without it fails in the dependency resolver with nothing to do with
this package (audioif#30).
