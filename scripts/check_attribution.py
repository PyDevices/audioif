"""Fail if a ported source has lost its upstream copyright notice.

Most C/H files under src/ are ports of CircuitPython (and through it,
MicroPython) sources. MIT requires the original copyright notice to travel
with the code, and upstream SPDX-headers its whole tree and lints for it.

Forty-five ported files had silently dropped that notice before 2026-09-02,
leaving a bare PyDevices copyright over code written by a dozen named
people. Nothing caught it, because the only signal is a prose sentence in
the header. This turns that sentence into the check: a file that says it
was ported must also say whose work it was.
