# Porting CircuitPython's audio system to MicroPython — plan

## Goal

Full parity with CircuitPython's audio system as a `USER_C_MODULES` MicroPython
usermod tree, targeting **mcu, unix, and windows** ports. In scope: the
complete DSP stack (`audiocore`, `audiomixer`, `audiodelays`, `audiofilters`,
`audiofreeverb`, `audiospeed`, `audiomp3`, `synthio` including `MidiTrack`)
plus output devices with CircuitPython `play()` semantics. `ulab` is a cloned
dependency, not a port (see below). Acceptance target: todbot's
[`synthtools`](https://github.com/todbot/CircuitPython_SynthTools) runs
unmodified.

> Plan revision note: v1 of this plan scoped only `synthio`, skipped
> `MidiTrack`/`audiocore`/`audiomixer`, and bridged output into
> `audiodev.PCMOutput`. All three calls are reversed here — see
> "Architecture" for why the audiosample pull protocol must be ported as the
> spine, and "ulab" for a correction (v1 claimed `synthtools` needs no ulab;
> `synthtools/waves.py` imports `ulab.numpy`).

## Verified facts this plan rests on

- **The DSP layer is provably hardware-independent.** CircuitPython's own
  unix `coverage` variant (`ports/unix/variants/coverage/mpconfigvariant.mk`)
  compiles every module listed above with **no** audio output device and no
  `audio_dma` — the workspace's `bin/circuitpython` (10.2.1) already contains
  all of them. `audio_dma` coupling exists only in `ports/*` output drivers,
  which we are replacing anyway.
- **`bin/circuitpython` is our parity oracle.** Any DSP test script can run
  on both interpreters and the rendered PCM compared sample-for-sample. This
  is the backbone of the test strategy.
- **ulab needs no porting.** CP's `extmod/ulab` submodule IS upstream
  [v923z/micropython-ulab](https://github.com/v923z/micropython-ulab)
  (pinned 6.5.2), which ships MicroPython usermod build glue at
  `code/micropython.mk` / `code/micropython.cmake`. Clone into `cmods/ulab`,
  pin to CP's revision for parity.
- **CP's protocol machinery maps onto mainline.** `py/proto.h` (60 lines
  total with `proto.c`) implements named protocols; mainline MicroPython has
  the same concept as the `protocol` type slot (used by `mp_stream_p_t`).
  The audiosample protocol ports as a slot-based protocol struct plus a
  small compat header.
- **Licenses are compatible.** CircuitPython shared-bindings/shared-module
  are MIT with per-file SPDX headers; this workspace is MIT. Carry the
  upstream copyright headers forward per-file. (`lib/mp3` for `audiomp3`
  has its own license — verify before vendoring, see open questions.)
- **Module sizes (10.2.1, bindings + shared-module, LOC):** synthio 4168,
  audiodelays 3231, audiofilters 2242, audiocore 1239, audiomixer 1155,
  audiomp3 923 (+ vendored `lib/mp3`), audiofreeverb 750, audiospeed ~600.
  Roughly 14k lines of portable C to port, plus compat shim and new output
  devices.

## Architecture

### The audiosample pull protocol is the spine

Everything in CP audio composes through one small protocol
(`shared-module/audiocore/__init__.h`, ~90 lines): `reset_buffer` /
`get_buffer` / a base struct carrying sample rate, bits, channels. Mixer
pulls from its voices, every effect pulls from its `source`, outputs pull
from whatever is `play()`ed, and `Synthesizer` *is* an audiosample. Porting
this protocol first — on mainline's `protocol` type slot — is what makes
every subsequent module a mostly-mechanical port and keeps them composable
exactly as upstream (`effects chained into Mixer into an output`, etc.).

The v1 idea (push rendered PCM into `audiodev.PCMOutput`) inverted this:
audiodev is push/write()-based and Python-level. It survives only as an
optional adapter (an object that pulls any audiosample and `write()`s into
any audiodev sink), useful for wasm/web output later — it is not the parity
surface.

### Module tiers and dependencies

```
tier 0  cp_compat: proto slot glue, py/enum.h shim, objproperty/attr shim,
        mp_arg_validate_* + translate() replacements, background-callback stub
tier 1  audiocore: audiosample protocol + RawSample + WaveFile   (pure, stream I/O)
tier 2  synthio: block layer, Math, LFO, Biquad, Note, Synthesizer, MidiTrack
        (Synthesizer/MidiTrack implement the tier-1 protocol; effects reuse
        synthio's Biquad/BlockInput, so synthio ports before the effects)
tier 3  audiomixer: Mixer, MixerVoice
tier 4  effects: audiofilters, audiodelays, audiofreeverb, audiospeed
tier 5  audiomp3 (vendored lib/mp3 decoder; license check first)
tier 6  outputs (new code, not a port — see below)
tier 7  audiodynamics, audioroute, audiomath: native, NOT CircuitPython ports
tier 8  lib/: pure-Python libraries built on the tiers above
        (audioinstruments, audioeffects, audiorender)
dep     ulab: cloned sibling at cmods/ulab, pinned to CP's 6.5.2
```

### Tiers 7 and 8 run the other way round

Everything through tier 6 answers "what does CircuitPython have that
MicroPython and CPython do not". Tiers 7 and 8 answer the opposite question,
and their source is micropython-vst3 rather than CircuitPython:

- **tier 7** is `audiodynamics` (compressor, limiter, downward expander, gate,
  transient shaper, with a high-passed detector for de-essing), `audioroute`
  (fan one stream out to parallel branches over a shared ring) and `audiomath`
  (multiply one stream by another). The first two lived in micropython-vst3's
  `vstaudio` usermod, which meant no application outside that plugin could use
  them and half of its own effects library could not be exercised offline at
  all. `audiomath` has no ancestor at all: nothing upstream and nothing in the
  engine multiplies two *streams*, which is what ring modulation needs and
  what an LFO at block rate cannot reach. CircuitPython has no equivalent to
  any of them, so `apply_cp_patches.sh` adds them to a CircuitPython tree —
  the only direction in this repo where CircuitPython is the recipient. See
  `docs/upstream-diff.md` for what changed in the moves and what was kept.
- **tier 8** is pure Python under `lib/`, published to boards by MIP from
  `<repo>/lib/<package>` and into the same wheel for CPython.
  `lib/audioinstruments/` is 53 classic synthesizers, keyboards and drum
  machines written entirely in `synthio` — no samples — and
  `lib/audioeffects/` is 40 effect classes built on the tiers above, both
  moved out of micropython-vst3 so they are not tied to a VST host.
  `lib/audiorender/` is the tier above those two: a composition — tracks, a
  tempo map, notes, automation, sections — rendered offline to a mixed
  master and the level report a render is judged by. It is the one part of
  this repository written for a desktop rather than a board (numpy
  throughout, the whole song in memory), so it ships in the wheel and
  `manifest.py` never freezes it. Loading a track's sound stays the
  caller's job: `render()` asks for a `voice_for(track, clock)` and only
  requires `deliver()` and `pull_frames()` back, which is what lets
  micropython-vst3 keep driving its own script loader through it.

Both have their own oracle, and it is the micropython-vst3 checkout rather
than `bin/circuitpython`: `tests/parity/verify_dsp.py` and
`tests/parity/run_instruments_parity.py`. Neither writes to that tree.

micropython-vst3 has since been cut over to import these packages instead
of carrying its own copies, so that checkout is no longer an independent
oracle for them: it *is* them. What still holds it honest is
`tests/parity/golden/vst3_render_reference.json`, captured from the
plug-in's six soundtrack pieces before the cutover and compared with
`tests/parity/capture_render_reference.py --verify`. Re-capture it after
any DSP change here, or it stops meaning anything.

### Output devices (the only new design work)

CP's `audioio.AudioOut` / `audiobusio.I2SOut` / `audiopwmio.PWMAudioOut` are
per-port DMA drivers — none port directly. Parity means reproducing their
*semantics*: `play(sample, loop=False)`, `stop()`, `pause()`/`resume()`,
`playing`, `paused`, pulling via the audiosample protocol.

- **Desktop (unix, windows):** one native `AudioOut` backed by SDL2's audio
  callback (SDL2 already lives in this workspace for `displayif`/usdl2; the
  callback thread pulls `get_buffer` on demand — the closest desktop
  analogue to CP's DMA-refill model). This is also what CP itself lacks on
  unix, so here we exceed the oracle: DSP correctness is tested against
  `bin/circuitpython`, playback by ear/WAV capture.
- **MCU:** a pump over `machine.I2S` non-blocking mode (its completion
  callback plays the role of the DMA-refill IRQ), exposed with the same
  `play()` API. Native per-SoC DMA drivers are a possible later
  optimization, not v1.
- **Adapter (optional):** audiosample → `audiodev.PCMOutput.write()` for
  wasm/web and any host audiodev already supports.

Teardown follows workspace rules (`displayif/AGENTS.md`): any output owning
host resources (SDL device, I2S instance) registers soft-reset teardown and
supports idempotent `deinit`.

### What "full parity" does NOT include (v1)

- `usb_midi` — USB device stack (TinyUSB) coupling; MIDI parity in v1 is
  `synthio.MidiTrack` (in scope, tier 2) plus pure-Python `adafruit_midi`
  over any stream/UART, which needs no port. Revisit against mainline's
  `machine.USBDevice` later.
- `audiobusio.PDMIn` (input capture) — hardware-specific; not needed for
  the playback/synthesis parity goal.
- `rotaryio`/`keypad`/other synth-adjacent CP hardware modules.

Build-glue detail: the cmods CMake aggregator finds `*/micropython.cmake` at
depth ≤ 3, so `cmods/ulab/code/micropython.cmake` is picked up as-is; but
Make ports glob only `$(USER_C_MODULES)/*/micropython.mk` (depth 1), so this
module's root `micropython.mk` must `include ../ulab/code/micropython.mk`
(or a one-line wrapper) for unix/windows builds.

## Phases

1. **Scaffolding** *(done)* — tracked dir, plan.
2. **ulab dep + tier 0 + skeleton** *(done)*. `cmods/ulab` cloned and pinned
   to CP's exact revision (`1d3ddd8`); both build flavors wired;
   `import ulab.numpy` works on unix MP (needed
   `MICROPY_MODULE_BUILTIN_SUBPACKAGES`, off by default on mainline — see
   micropython.mk). `cp_compat` built: `argcheck`, `enum`, `objproperty`,
   `context_manager_helpers`, `proto`, `util` — each individually checked
   against mainline MicroPython before porting, not assumed missing.
   8 module skeletons registered.
3. **Tier 1 `audiocore`** *(done)*. Protocol (`audiosample_get_buffer` and
   friends) + `RawSample` + `WaveFile` all ported and passing oracle-diff
   tests against `bin/circuitpython` (`RawSample`: full property/deinit/
   context-manager/PCM diff, byte-for-byte match; `WaveFile`: PCM verified
   against Python's own `wave` module instead, since CP's own unix build
   can't open a WaveFile at all — see docs/upstream-diff.md). Found and
   fixed a real gap along the way: mainline has no code path that invokes a
   declarative property on a *native* type (CP patches this into its own
   core `py/runtime.c`); every ported type needs an explicit
   `attr, cp_compat_attr` slot instead — see docs/upstream-diff.md,
   "Property invocation needs an explicit attr slot." This applies to every
   remaining tier, not just audiocore.
4. **Tier 2 `synthio`** *(done)*. Full engine ported in dependency order
   (block layer → Math/LFO/Biquad → Note → Synthesizer → MidiTrack), all
   oracle-diffed against `bin/circuitpython` 10.2.1 byte-for-byte: `Math`
   (all operations), `LFO` (multi-tick phase accumulation), `Biquad`
   (filter coefficients), `Envelope`, and — the acceptance case — a full
   `Synthesizer` note press → attack → decay → sustain → release → PCM
   render cycle, plus a `MidiTrack` melody, both bit-exact against upstream.
   `synthio.from_file()` got the same portable-stream adaptation as
   `WaveFile` (see docs/upstream-diff.md); everything else is a mechanical,
   oracle-verified port. One new compat piece needed: `cp_compat/namedtuple`
   (CP's `py/objnamedtuple.h` extension for building a const namedtuple
   type at compile time, used for `Envelope`) — same "verify against
   mainline before porting" discipline as tier 0/1's shims. Full regression
   clean (`build_interpreters.sh`, LVGL smoke test, all 8 module stubs)
   after every change.
5. **Tier 3 `audiomixer`** *(done)*. `Mixer` + `MixerVoice` ported
   (`src/audiomixer/`), oracle-diffed against `bin/circuitpython` 10.2.1
   byte-for-byte across every branch of the mixdown engine: mono→mono,
   mono source upmixed into a stereo mixer with panning, 16-bit signed and
   8-bit unsigned sample formats, single- and multi-voice mixdown
   (verbatim-copy vs. add-mixed paths), looping, and `level`/`panning`
   driven by a `synthio.LFO`/`synthio.Math` block input. Two deviations,
   both mechanical (see docs/upstream-diff.md): the `#if CIRCUITPY_SYNTHIO`
   guard around block-input level/panning is unconditional here (this port
   always has synthio); ARM CMSIS DSP intrinsics dropped for the portable C
   fallback unconditionally (numerically identical, avoids a CMSIS
   dependency this port doesn't vendor -- relevant for phase 9 mcu
   builds). Full regression clean (`build_interpreters.sh`, LVGL smoke
   test, all module imports) after every change.

6. **Tier 4 effects** *(done)*. All nine types across four modules ported
   (`src/audiospeed/`, `src/audiofreeverb/`, `src/audiofilters/`,
   `src/audiodelays/`): `SpeedChanger`; `Freeverb`; `Filter`, `Distortion`,
   `Phaser`; `Chorus`, `Echo`, `MultiTapDelay`, `PitchShift`. All
   oracle-diffed byte-for-byte across mono/stereo, 8/16-bit signed/
   unsigned, looping, block-input-driven (`synthio.LFO`) parameters,
   mid-stream parameter changes, and stop/tail-drain behavior. `SpeedChanger`
   needed a temporary one-off oracle rebuild (`CIRCUITPY_AUDIOSPEED` isn't
   in the canonical unix coverage build); every deviation and verbatim-kept
   upstream quirk (a union type-pun, a `memset` fill-value truncation, an
   inconsistent `single_channel_output` check, two custom `__exit__`
   overrides) is catalogued in docs/upstream-diff.md. Full regression clean
   (`build_interpreters.sh`, LVGL smoke test, all module imports) after
   every change.
7. **`synthtools` end-to-end (unix)** *(done)*. **Primary acceptance
   milestone.** Vendored todbot's `CircuitPython_SynthTools` unmodified
   (`tests/vendor/synthtools`, MIT); a new acceptance script
   (`tests/parity/synthtools_acceptance.py`) drives its `SubtractiveSynth`
   and `BasslineSynth` engines through a real `Synthesizer` + `Mixer` +
   `EffectsChain` (tier 4's `Filter`/`Distortion`/`Echo`), oracle-diffed
   byte-for-byte against `bin/circuitpython`. Found and fixed a genuine
   port bug this way, not just confirmed the port: `synthio`'s
   `CIRCUITPY_SYNTHIO_MAX_CHANNELS` (max concurrent Notes per
   Synthesizer) defaulted to CP's own conservative 2 with no build
   override, while the oracle's unix `coverage` variant is itself built
   with 14 -- silently truncating polyphony past 2 concurrent Notes (any
   two-oscillator/detuned patch with two held notes already needs 4).
   Fixed in `micropython.mk` for unix/windows only; mcu (`micropython.cmake`)
   is left at CP's default pending phase 10's own RAM/polyphony call. Full
   detail, including the isolation methodology and the deterministic-PRNG
   test-harness technique needed for a byte-exact diff (`synthtools`
   reseeds oscillator phase via `random.randint()` by design), is in
   docs/upstream-diff.md. Full regression clean (tier 0-4 parity suite,
   LVGL smoke test) after the fix.
8. **Tier 6 outputs** *(8a-8e done; superseded design)*. The original plan
   here (a native SDL2-callback `AudioOut`) was replaced after actually
   reading `pydevices/lib/audiodev`: that package's whole design is
   push-based (`write()` + a mandatory per-tick `service()`) specifically
   *because* an audio-thread callback into Python is unsafe -- and that
   holds even in C once the callback would need to pull a `synthio` block
   graph, which allocates on the GC heap. The actual architecture: a new
   pure-Python pump, `audiodev.sample_out.AudioOut`
   (`pydevices/lib/audiodev/sample_out.py`), pulls PCM from any audiosample
   via `audiocore.get_buffer()`/`reset_buffer()` on a lookahead schedule and
   pushes it into any existing `audiodev` PCM transport (sdl2/win/wasm/i2s/
   emulated) -- giving CircuitPython's `play(sample, loop=)`/`stop()`/
   `pause()`/`resume()`/`playing` for free over every backend `audiodev`
   already supports, no output-device C code needed here at all. Full
   design writeup, board-by-board wiring, and rationale live in
   `pydevices/docs/audio.md` and `pydevices/lib/audiodev/README.md`
   ("`sample_out.py` -- `AudioOut`"), not here, since none of this touches
   the usermod tree.
   - **8a (done):** `AudioOut` written; every board's `audio_out` role
     rewired to return one (`board_configs/desktop`, the ESP32-P4, both
     M5Stack Tab5 variants, m5stack-cores3, t-embed, windisplay, jndisplay);
     `pygame_audio`/`web_audio` kept as raw-PCM-only transports (neither can
     back an `AudioOut` -- no usermod under CPython/PyScript) rather than
     deleted, since `pgdisplay`/`psdisplay` depend on them directly; full
     `pydevices` + `pydevices-examples` test suites green, including a new
     WAV-golden test (`tests/test_audio_playback_golden.py`) that renders a
     real `synthio`/`audiomixer` script through `AudioOut` on
     `bin/micropython`/`bin/circuitpython`/`micropython.exe` and diffs the
     output byte-for-byte -- passed on the first run across all three.
   - **8b (done):** `pydevices-examples/lib/examples/piano.py` migrated off
     the old `utils.audio.AudioEngine` onto a real `synthio.Synthesizer`
     (additive-wave voices, `synthio.Envelope`) through `AudioOut` -- the
     unix acceptance demo. `widgets_locker_kiosk.py` (still uses
     `AudioEngine` for simple UI blips) fixed to pull the raw transport via
     `audio_out.transport` now that the role returns an `AudioOut`; same fix
     applied to `audio_out_test.py`/`audio_in_playback_test.py`, the two
     raw-PCM portability smoke scripts. `utils/audio.py`/`AudioEngine`
     itself was *not* retired (a real remaining consumer), unlike the
     original phase 8 wording assumed.
   - **8c (done):** DSP parity suite (all tiers) plus
     `synthtools_acceptance.py` re-run under `bin/micropython.exe`,
     diffed against `bin/circuitpython` -- found and fixed a genuine,
     windows-only bug this way: `audiomp3`'s `stream_readable()` calls
     `MP_STREAM_POLL`, which mainline's own `extmod/vfs_posix_file.c` raises
     `NotImplementedError` from on `_WIN32` for a real file object, so
     `MP3Decoder` reading an `open()`ed file was completely broken on
     `micropython.exe`. Fixed with an `#ifdef _WIN32` fallback in
     `src/audiomp3/MP3Decoder.c` (see docs/upstream-diff.md, "Tier 5
     audiomp3: three Windows-only local fixes"). A mechanical `win_audio`
     `AudioOut` smoke (construct, play a `synthio.Note`, service, close, no
     hardware errors) also passed under `micropython.exe`; true by-ear
     verification is left for Brad, since this environment has no speakers.
   - **8d (mostly done):** Rebuilt `micropython.mjs`/`.wasm`
     (`build_interpreters.sh --only mp-wasm`); fixed five real
     emscripten-only portability bugs found along the way (an mp3dec.h
     platform-detection gap, two merged-header duplicate-typedef errors, a
     missing `M_PI`, dead-code/`-Wunused-function`, a missing
     `<errno.h>`/an implicit float promotion in `MP3Decoder.c` -- see
     docs/upstream-diff.md, "Phase 8d: WASM build fixes"). Ran the full DSP
     parity suite (tiers 0-5 + `synthtools_acceptance.py`) against the
     rebuilt interpreter via a headless Node driver
     (`loadMicroPython()`/`runPythonAsync`, no wasm-equivalent CLI exists)
     and diffed against `bin/circuitpython`: byte-for-byte identical except
     three documented, environment-only gaps in the ad hoc Node harness
     itself (no file staged for the mp3 fixture, a JS-wrapped traceback
     format, no `__file__` under `runPythonAsync`) -- none a DSP bug. Along
     the way, found and fixed a real, more consequential bug: tier 4's
     verbatim-kept `Distortion.soft_clip` union type-pun turned out to be
     architecture-dependent, not a stable quirk -- wrong on wasm32, and
     (by the same reasoning) most likely wrong on real 32-bit-ARM
     CircuitPython hardware too, which the earlier x86-64-only verification
     could never have caught. Fixed properly (`.u_bool`, not `.u_obj`); now
     produces byte-identical output across all three of this port's own
     targets (unix/windows/wasm) and a deliberate, documented divergence
     from the x86-64 CP oracle for that one field -- see docs/upstream-diff.md,
     "Distortion soft_clip: verbatim-kept union type-pun turned out to be
     architecture-dependent." Full regression clean on unix/windows/wasm
     after the fix (parity suite, LVGL smoke test on unix).
     Also extended `pydevices-examples/tools/wasm_browser/run_contract.py`
     with a new `check_audio_out` check: a real `synthio.Synthesizer`
     pressed/released and played through `audiodev.sample_out.AudioOut`
     over `wasm_audio.WasmPCMOutput`, driven by a fake manually-advanced
     clock (same technique as `audio_playback_golden_probe.py`) for
     determinism, asserting the resulting `AudioBufferSource` schedulings
     carry real, non-silent, non-clipped PCM -- not just that the DSP
     usermod imports. Passed cleanly (12 buffers, 3072 real PCM frames) on
     all three Playwright engines (chromium, firefox, webkit). 8d is done.
   - **8e (done):** ESP32-P4 (`esp32p4wifi6`) CMake decisions made while
     actually building the firmware: `CIRCUITPY_SYNTHIO_MAX_CHANNELS` raised
     from the header default of 2 (confirmed broken for real patches, see
     8d) to 8 for CMake/mcu ports generally -- a deliberately modest choice
     versus desktop/wasm's 14, since mcu RAM headroom varies far more than
     across this workspace's three host targets; audiomp3 deliberately still
     not wired for CMake ports (a concrete new blocker found: `cmods/mp3/src
     /mp3dec.h`'s platform list has no RISC-V branch, and the P4 is
     RISC-V -- would need the same `MP3DEC_GENERIC` treatment as wasm, not
     worth building for a board with no MP3 demo). Firmware **built**
     (`./build_mp.sh --port esp32 --board ESP32_GENERIC_P4 --variant
     C6_WIFI`, no source changes needed beyond the CMake decisions above --
     the usermod compiled clean on RISC-V/ESP-IDF 5.5 on the first try) and
     measured: `micropython.bin` 3,254,688 bytes; the default factory
     partition (0x2f0000, ~3.09 MiB) was too small and the build's
     autosize-and-retry step resized it to 0x360000 (~3.375 MiB)
     automatically, landing at 8% partition headroom -- unremarkable given
     this board's flash size, but recorded here as the actual figure.
     **On-device verification done** once mpftp's new CLI (`docs/agent-guide.md`
     in the `mpftp` repo -- session model changed significantly since the
     "write-to-file" workaround this project used earlier; the standalone
     form is `./scripts/mpftp <cmd> -d COM4`, one full session per
     invocation) confirmed available: rebuilt the firmware (picking up the
     Distortion.c fix above), backed up `/wifi.py` and `/secrets.py` off
     the board first, flashed with `--erase` (required -- the new
     firmware's grown partition table didn't match the one already on the
     device, exactly as anticipated), restored both files, then pushed
     `audiodev` (including the new `sample_out.py`), `multimer`,
     `board_config.py`/`board_peripherals.py`, `boarddev.py`, and the
     driver files the board's own eager bring-up needs (`gt911`,
     `keypad_gpio`, `keys`, `displaydev`, ES8311/ES7210) directly over
     serial (`mpftp put`/`cp --verify`) -- deliberately not via `mip`,
     since that would have pulled the last-published (unmodified) copies
     from GitHub and overwritten the local fixes being verified. A probe
     script (real `synthio.Synthesizer`, note press/release through a real
     7-note arpeggio, `pause()`/`resume()`, hardware volume/mute via the
     ES8311 codec, `stop()`/`close()`) ran clean end to end on real
     hardware via `mpftp run --follow`, and ran identically clean a second
     time after `mpftp soft-reset` -- confirming both the audio pipeline
     itself and codec re-init survive a soft reset without stale state.
     Wi-Fi reconnected from the restored `secrets.py` and got a real DHCP
     lease, confirming the board is left in a working state. Phase 8 is
     now fully done, including on-device hardware verification.
9. **Tier 5 `audiomp3`** *(done)* — ported out of order (before phase 8,
   which is blocked on mpftp/hardware coordination), since nothing else
   depends on it and it needs no hardware. License checked first (see
   docs/upstream-diff.md, "Tier 5 audiomp3: license"): the Helix decoder
   core is RPSL 1.0/RCSL 1.0, not MIT, and this port carries it unmodified
   under those terms rather than relicensing it -- same as CircuitPython
   itself. Cloned `cmods/mp3` (upstream `adafruit/Adafruit_MP3`) as a
   sibling dependency pinned to the exact commit
   `cmods/circuitpython/lib/mp3` vendors, same treatment as `cmods/ulab`.
   `MP3Decoder` ported to `src/audiomp3/` (merged shared-bindings +
   shared-module, matching every other tier); needed a `background_callback`
   compat stub (`cp_compat/background_callback.h`) -- CircuitPython's own
   unix coverage build (this port's oracle) already collapses that whole
   API to a synchronous same-thread call, so there was nothing to actually
   port, only to make permanent. Oracle-diffed byte-for-byte against
   `bin/circuitpython` on a real MP3 file (`cmods/mp3/examples/test.mp3`):
   full-track decode, RMS level, samples-decoded count, the
   `reset_buffer`-driven loop-to-start behavior (including a faithfully
   reproduced, non-obvious quirk -- a second pass decodes a different byte
   count than the first, confirmed identical on both interpreters, not a
   bug), a pre-allocated user buffer, stream-object input, `file`
   get/set, explicit `open()`, and error paths (text-mode file, malformed
   MP3 data). Needed two Windows-only local fixes with no unix impact: a
   patch to the vendored `cmods/mp3/src/assembly.h` (its MSVC-only
   inline-asm branch also matched mingw-w64, which also defines `_WIN32`)
   and dropping `MP_WEAK` from this port's own `mp3_alloc`/`mp3_free`
   (mingw-w64's PE-COFF linker doesn't resolve a lone weak definition the
   way ELF does). Full regression clean (`build_interpreters.sh` for both
   unix and windows, LVGL smoke test, full tier 0-4 parity suite,
   `synthtools_acceptance.py`) after every change.
10. **Port matrix + footprint** *(done)*.
    Float/`mp_float_t` config already checked (phase 8d verification note):
    unix, windows, and wasm are all `MICROPY_FLOAT_IMPL_DOUBLE`, confirmed
    directly from each port's `mpconfigport.h`/variant headers, which is
    why DSP output stays byte-exact across all three. mcu build + measured
    flash/RAM cost: phase 8e's ESP32-P4 data point (`micropython.bin`
    3,254,688 bytes; app partition resized 0x2f0000 → 0x360000, 8% headroom)
    was a generous-flash board, not the smallest-target case this phase
    calls for. Closed that gap with a second, genuinely small/RAM-constrained
    build: `./build_mp.sh --port rp2 --board RPI_PICO` (RP2040 -- 2 MiB
    flash, 264 KiB RAM, no PSRAM, the most flash/RAM-starved board this
    workspace currently targets) -- built clean on the first try, same
    CMake glue as the P4 (no board-specific source changes needed).
    `firmware.bin`: 1,462,324 bytes against RPI_PICO's 2,097,152-byte flash
    -- 69.7% used, ~30.3% headroom -- with the *entire* workspace stack
    linked in (LVGL, ulab, pygraphics, displayif, audioif tiers
    0-4/6), not audio in isolation; tier 5 (audiomp3) is excluded on RP2040
    for the same reason it's excluded on the P4: not wired for any CMake
    port yet (see below), not a board-specific limitation -- RP2040's
    Cortex-M0+ is `__ARMEL__`, which `cmods/mp3/src/mp3dec.h` already
    recognizes, so audiomp3 has no RP2040-specific blocker once someone
    does the CMake-port-detection work tier 8e deferred for RISC-V.
    Per-port enable flags, as they exist today:
    - **`CIRCUITPY_SYNTHIO_MAX_CHANNELS`** (max concurrent `Note`s per
      `Synthesizer`; header default 2, confirmed broken for real patches --
      see phase 7/8d): unix/windows set it to 14 (`micropython.mk`, matching
      CP's own unix `coverage` variant); every CMake/mcu port (esp32 *and*
      rp2, since `micropython.cmake` applies workspace-wide, not
      per-board) gets a flat 8 (`audioif/micropython.cmake`) --
      a deliberately modest, not-yet-per-board-tuned middle ground. A board
      with more headroom (P4 has PSRAM) or less can override via
      `target_compile_definitions`/`CFLAGS_EXTRA` per board; nothing in
      this workspace does that override yet, since 8 held up fine on both
      the P4 and the far-tighter RPI_PICO build.
    - **`CIRCUITPY_AUDIOMP3` / tier 5 wiring** *(now wired for CMake ports
      too)*: initially deferred here as "off for every CMake port pending
      RISC-V-style `MP3DEC_GENERIC` detection" -- closed that gap rather
      than leaving it open, since it turned out narrower than expected:
      mp3dec.h's closed list has no Xtensa branch either, so *every* esp32
      target (Xtensa: esp32/s2/s3; RISC-V: c2/c3/c5/c6/p4) needs the same
      escape hatch, while rp2 (ARM, native match) needs nothing.
      `audioif/micropython.cmake` now wires tier 5 the same way
      `micropython.mk` does (sources, include dir, the `mp3_alloc`
      allocator `-include`/`-fwrapv` on `buffers.c`), gated by ESP-IDF's
      own `CONFIG_IDF_TARGET_ARCH_RISCV`/`_ARCH_XTENSA` sdkconfig variables
      (the same ones `esp32_common.cmake` itself branches on) rather than
      re-deriving "which CMake port is this" from scratch. One genuine new
      wrinkle found while wiring it, not anticipated at the P4 8e writeup:
      `target_compile_definitions(usermod_mpaudio INTERFACE
      MP3DEC_GENERIC)` reaches the real per-file compile fine (ninja
      resolves the INTERFACE chain), but ESP-IDF's QSTR-extraction
      preprocessing pass (`py/mkrules.cmake`'s `qstr.i.last` rule) builds
      its own flag list via a raw `get_target_property(MICROPY_TARGET
      COMPILE_DEFINITIONS)` that does *not* walk linked INTERFACE
      libraries -- confirmed by diffing that pass's actual `-E` invocation
      against the real compile rule's `DEFINES` (present in the latter,
      absent in the former), and it hit mp3dec.h's `#error` directly since
      QSTR scanning still has to fully preprocess every source.
      `py/py.cmake`'s own `micropy_gather_target_properties()` exists to
      bridge exactly this INTERFACE-library gap, but `esp32_common.cmake`
      only calls it over registered ESP-IDF components -- "usermod" isn't
      one, it's a plain target inside the main component, so that loop
      never reaches it. Fixed portably (not an esp32-only patch) by
      appending directly to `MICROPY_CPP_DEF_EXTRA`, the same accumulator
      both that gather-loop and `mkrules.cmake`'s own qstr flag-building
      read from -- a normal (non-cache) CMake variable write, valid because
      usermod.cmake (and our aggregator beneath it) is `include()`d, not
      `add_subdirectory()`d, into the port's own variable scope.
      Verified end to end: rebuilt both mcu data points from scratch.
      ESP32-P4 (`--port esp32 --board ESP32_GENERIC_P4 --variant C6_WIFI`,
      the `MP3DEC_GENERIC`/RISC-V branch): clean build,
      `micropython.bin` grew 3,254,688 → 3,293,648 bytes against the same
      0x360000 partition, headroom 8% → 7%. RPI_PICO (the native-ARM
      branch, no `MP3DEC_GENERIC` needed): clean build, `firmware.bin` grew
      1,462,324 → 1,497,556 bytes against 2,097,152, headroom ~30.3% →
      ~28.6%. Both real, fresh builds, not just "no compile errors" --
      confirms the fix holds on both branches of the arch split, and
      audiomp3 is no longer a per-board-flash decision CircuitPython itself
      still has to make on some targets (`espressif`, `atmel-samd` both
      default `CIRCUITPY_AUDIOMP3` off there) that this port simply can't
      offer -- it can now, and per-board on/off is a normal
      `target_compile_definitions` override away if a future board needs
      the flash back.
    - No board in this workspace currently needs a *narrower* audio build
      (e.g. audiocore-only, no synthio/mixer/effects) to fit -- both mcu
      data points (P4, RPI_PICO) fit the full tier 0-4/6 stack with double-
      digit headroom. If a future board doesn't, the module-per-tier `.c`
      file layout in `micropython.cmake`'s `target_sources()` list is
      already the seam to split on (drop a tier's `target_sources` +
      `mpaudio_modules.c` registration entries; the Python-level `import`
      then just fails on that module, matching real CircuitPython's own
      `CIRCUITPY_AUDIOFOO=0` behavior).
11. **Spin-off.** Split into its own PyDevices repo, symlink back into
    cmods like `pygraphics`/`displayif`, re-ignore the path here.

## Testing strategy (recap)

- **Oracle diffing is the core:** every DSP tier lands with scripts under
  `tests/parity/` that run unchanged on `bin/circuitpython` and the MP
  build, rendering PCM to stdout/file; the runner asserts byte-equality
  (or bounded error where float-width differences make byte-exactness
  impossible — record any such case in `upstream-diff.md`).
- Mainline-MP-only concerns (protocol slot behavior, soft reset, output
  lifecycle) get ordinary unit tests in `tests/`.
- CI-friendly throughout: no audio hardware needed until phase 7, and even
  then WAV-capture paths keep it scriptable.

## Open questions

- **`lib/mp3` license** — CP vendors an MP3 decoder; confirm its license
  allows carrying into this repo before tier 5.
- **`mp_float_t` width.** CP unix builds double-precision; MP mcu configs
  are often single-float. Decide early (phase 4) whether parity tests
  demand double on all targets or tolerate bounded drift on single-float
  mcu builds.
- **ulab pin drift.** CP 10.2.1 pins ulab 6.5.2; upstream moves. Pin ours
  to CP's revision and revisit only when the CP checkout moves.
- **Frozen-vs-mip delivery of `synthtools`** for phase 6 (vendored copy in
  tests vs `mip.install` at test time).
