# Building and publishing wheels

`pydevices-audioif` is a native CPython distribution. Build a local source
archive and wheel with:

```sh
python -m build
```

A GitHub Release `vX.Y.Z` — matching the `VERSION` file, which is also where
`_audioif.__version__` comes from — invokes the organization `publishing-v8`
workflow (the pin is the `@publishing-v8` ref in
`.github/workflows/publish-release-packages.yml`) with
`build-kind: native-and-wasm`. It builds and validates exactly **21** wheels:

- CPython 3.10–3.14, manylinux_2_28 x86_64, Windows AMD64, and
  macosx_arm64 — 15.
- CPython 3.13–3.14, Android API 21 arm64_v8a/x86_64 and Pyodide wasm32 — 6.

(This paragraph said `publishing-v6` and 16 wheels until 2026-09-02, having
gone stale when macOS landed. The count that matters is
`expected-wheel-count` in `publish-release-packages.yml`; if this prose and
that value ever disagree again, **the workflow is right**.)

## macOS: enabled, CI-proven

macOS is enabled at the org's **CI-proven** tier ("PyDevices ships
everything for macOS that CI can prove" — see the organization
`platform-support-tiers.md`): the `test-cpython.yml` workflow builds,
installs, and runs the full unit/contract/parity suite and
`tools/validate_api.py` on `macos-latest`, and its `macos-wheels` job
runs the same cibuildwheel the release path uses — compiling the native
extension for CPython 3.10–3.14 and running the import smoke test in
each wheel — on every push, publishing nothing. Hardware audio output
on a real Mac remains **community-verified**: no Mac is on our bench,
and a field report is what promotes that claim.

**Arch choice: `macosx_arm64` only.** The runner is Apple Silicon; an
x86_64 (or universal2) wheel cross-compiled there could not run its
test-command, and an untested wheel is a claim, not a capability. An
Intel-Mac field report is what would add x86_64.

**The release-time gap is closed** (corrected 2026-09-02; this section
described it as open long after it shut). `macos-latest` joined the org
desktop matrix in **publishing-v7**, this repository is pinned at
**`@publishing-v8`**, and `expected-wheel-count` is already **21** — the
five `macosx_arm64` wheels ship. Hardware audio output on a real Mac is
still community-verified; that part has not changed.

## Linux aarch64: enabled, CI-proven; not yet shipped

**Decided 2026-09-02 (Brad): add Linux ARM.** aarch64 is the Raspberry Pi
and every 64-bit SBC — real users on a tier the organization's
`platform-support-tiers.md` already claims desktop-Linux coverage for,
while shipping no ARM wheel. That gap between claim and artifact is the
cause; "it would be nice" is not.

`[tool.cibuildwheel.linux]` uses **`archs = ["auto64"]`** — the runner's
own 64-bit architecture — with `manylinux_2_28` images for both x86_64 and
aarch64. Naming `["x86_64", "aarch64"]` explicitly would have been a
release-breaking mistake: the x86_64 release runner would then try to build
aarch64 under QEMU, which no workflow configures. `auto64` resolves to
x86_64 on an x86_64 runner and aarch64 on an ARM one, so one config is
correct everywhere and an ARM release cell needs no config change at all.

`test-cpython.yml` proves it two ways on **native ARM runners**
(`ubuntu-24.04-arm`) rather than under QEMU:

- the full matrix — build, install, unit/contract tests, `validate_api`,
  and all four parity verifiers — runs on aarch64 for CPython 3.10–3.14;
- a `linux-arm-wheels` job runs the same cibuildwheel the release path
  uses, compiling the extension and executing each wheel's import smoke
  test. Nothing is published.

**Native, not emulated, deliberately.** Under QEMU each wheel's
test-command runs on a faithful *simulation* of the target. The bugs
worth catching here are the ones that differ by architecture, which is
exactly the class an emulator reproduces only by accident. An untested
wheel is a claim; a wheel tested on emulated hardware is a weaker claim
than it looks.

**What the ARM lane found on its first run — and it is worth knowing
whatever happens to ARM wheels.** aarch64 does *not* reproduce audioif's
effects output byte for byte. Three of the four parity gates
(`verify_acceptance`, `verify_streaming`, `verify_biquad`) are identical;
`verify_effects` is not. Measured: **6 of 744 numeric fields differ,
largest absolute deviation 1 in every case**, confined to `multitap` and
`pitchshift` — the two effects doing delay-line interpolation, which is
where a compiler's fused multiply-add changes the rounding. Those fields
are `sum(data)` over a 512-byte block, so a delta of 1 is one byte off by
one: **1 LSB of int16, about −90 dBFS.**

The rule this settles (Brad, 2026-09-02): **bit-identical audio is
required within one CPU architecture, not across them.** So no tolerance
was introduced anywhere. The gate stays exact everywhere and each
architecture is held to its own recorded baseline, accepted deliberately
with its evidence written beside it in
`tests/parity/golden/effects_component.json`. That is both a faithful
reading of the rule and a stricter regression detector than a threshold.

One caveat travels with that measurement, filed as
[#15](https://github.com/PyDevices/audioif/issues/15): the gate hashes
per-block **sums**, not PCM, so drifts that cancel within a block are
invisible to it. The 1-LSB figure is therefore a lower bound on agreement,
not a proof of it — true of every architecture the gate has ever passed,
x86_64 included.

**Release-time gap, precisely — this one IS open.** The organization
desktop matrix (`reusable-build-native-and-wasm-wheels.yml`, at
`publishing-v8`) runs `ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest` and
`macos-latest`. There is no ARM cell, so **a release still ships no
aarch64 wheel** and `expected-wheel-count` stays 21. Closing it is three
coupled steps, all outside this repository:

1. add an ARM runner to that matrix (the macOS comment there describes
   the same shape: repos that skip the arch build a no-op cell);
2. cut the new `publishing-vN` tag;
3. move this repository's pin and raise `expected-wheel-count` 21 → 26
   in the same change.

Steps 2 and 3 are release-machinery version decisions and belong to Brad.
The work here means that when they happen, the ARM lane is a matrix line
rather than a discovery.

## The remaining exclusions

Each with its cause rather than by silence:

- **musllinux** — **decided 2026-09-02 (Brad): stay skipped.** It doubles
  the Linux matrix for the Alpine family, and the test that admitted
  aarch64 is what excludes it: we can name aarch64's users (every Pi and
  SBC, on a tier we already claim) and cannot name musllinux's. Revisit
  if an actual Alpine user asks. Remains in `pyproject.toml`'s
  cibuildwheel `skip` list.
- **win32** (32-bit Windows) — every Windows target here is 64-bit: the
  wheel matrix builds AMD64 only and the validation hosts are 64-bit;
  nothing in this repository has ever been built or tested 32-bit. Also in
  the cibuildwheel `skip` list.
- **Linux ARM** — no longer an exclusion; see the aarch64 section above.
  The old note here said ARM would need QEMU on x86_64 runners. GitHub now
  offers native `ubuntu-24.04-arm` runners to public repositories, so the
  premise that made it expensive is gone.
- **MicroPython `.mpy`** — the native modules are firmware: MicroPython and
  CircuitPython build them from `src/` as a usermod, so there is nothing
  for MIP to carry (recorded in `publish-release-packages.yml`). The
  pure-Python tier publishes to MIP as source; compiling it to `.mpy`
  would pin it to one bytecode version per MicroPython release, and no
  decision to take that on has been made.

After TestPyPI publication, run
`python scripts/test_testpypi_install.py` on fresh Linux and Windows hosts.
